<div><h1 class='nobreak'>A TALE OF THREE TAILS</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/D.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='D'/>OWN in Honduras there is a town called Pueblo
de Chamelecón which is not much of a town after
all. There is only one street in it, and the houses
are like big beehives that have been squared up, and the
roofs are of straw. There is no sidewalk, no roadway, and
the houses are unfenced, so that you step from the room
into the sandy street and, because of the heat, when you are
inside you wish that you were out, and when you are outside
you wish that you were in. So the children of the place
spend much time down at the little river. At least they did
when I was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I rode there on a donkey and, the day being hot, let the
animal graze, or sleep, or think, or dream, or work out
problems—or whatever it is that a donkey does with his
spare time—and I watched the children in the water.
There was one, a little baby just able to toddle around, who
crawled down to the water’s edge, rolled in and swam about
like a little dog, much as the babies of Tierra del Fuego
will swim in the icy waters of the Far South. He came out
on my side of the water, as lively as a grig, smiling every bit
as friendly as any other little chap of his age, white, brown,
or yellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stayed there that night because the day did not get cool
and in the evening the people sat outside of their houses
and played the guitar and sang. Now I had with me a
little musical instrument like a tiny organ, which I bought
in France, and it was so compact and handy that I could
carry it everywhere as easily as I could a blanket. In fact,
I used to ride with it behind my saddle, wrapped in my
bedding. Well, as the people seemed to like their music, I
brought out mine, so we had a very jolly concert, in spite
of my poor voice, which they politely pretended not to
notice. Then later, from curiosity, the children came
about me and, to amuse them as well as myself, having done
so badly at the singing, I did a few tricks with wads of
rolled paper and a couple of tin cups, and the little boy
who had swum across the pond laughed as loudly as any one
there. That pleased his father mightily, so much indeed
that he brought me a cup of goat’s milk and some cassava
bread and told me that I was a fine fellow. To please
me further, he sang a very, very long song. It was all about
the parrot and the wonderful things it did, a parrot that
had lived long among people and learned their songs, and
when the bird flew back to the forest, it still sang, and so
well that all the other parrots in the forest learned to sing
the song from beginning to end. But what was curious was
that at the end of every other verse, there was this line:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>When the rat had a tail like a horse.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>So when he had done I asked him about that, for all the
rats I had seen had tails which were far from beautiful,
according to my notion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man listened gravely, then said: “But certainly, once
the rat had a tail like a horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When was that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the rabbit had a tail like a cat,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am still puzzled,” I told him. “Was it long ago?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was when the deer’s tail was plumed like the tail of a
dog,” he told me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we talked, a kind of polite silence was upon all the
people gathered about us; then a very, very old woman
who was smoking a cigar nodded her head and said: “But
Tio Ravenna is right. It was in the days of Hunbatz, who
lived on beetles and spiders, and I heard it from my mother’s
mother, and she from the mother of her mother.” Then
the old woman went on smoking with her eyes closed, and
all who were there nodded at one another, thinking, I suppose,
that the old grandmother would presently tell the
story. But of course, they who knew her well were wiser
than to ask her to tell the Tale of Three Tails, so every one
waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, a little girl gave the old grandmother a piece
of sugar and asked: “Was it two brothers, or three, who had
to clear the great forest? I am not sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that the little old lady’s eyes were bright and she threw
away her cigar and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two brothers. That I have told you before.” After
a little sigh, which was only pretending that she was weary
of telling the tale, she said: “You know that I have told
it to you before, and it is wrong that I should have to tell it
so often. But you see this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So saying, she took from her bosom, where she had it
fastened to a silk thread, a little piece of jade and let us see
it. It was broken from a larger piece, but we could make
out on it a carving which I saw to be a deer with a tail like
a sheep dog’s. We passed it about and every one looked
at it carefully, although certainly all of them must have
seen it time and time again, and when it came to the old
grandmother again she replaced it and told us the Tale of
Three Tails, just as I have written it here.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Once, long ago, the rat had a beautiful tail like a horse,
with long sweeping hairs, though it was before my time of
life. It was in the days of old Hunbatz, and he was a wizard
who lived in the dark of the great forest that used to be
on the other side of the big river. In those days things
were not as now and animals were different; some larger,
some smaller. The deer, as you have seen on the stone I
showed you, had a tail like a dog, and the rabbit’s tail was
long and furry like the tail of a cat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now in that land there was a hunter with whom neither
lasso nor arrow ever failed, and he had two sons, beautiful
to look at and brave of heart, stout and quick of foot.
Not only did the brothers work better than any men had
ever worked, but they could play ball and sing, throwing
the ball higher than birds could fly, and singing in a way
that brought the wild things to hear them. Nor was there
living creature able to run as swiftly as the two brothers.
The birds alone could outrace them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brothers being grown, their father thought that it
was time for them to make a home for themselves, so chose
a place on the farther side of the forest, and told them to
clear it, which, he said, could be done in seven days. It
was no little forest, you must remember, but a vast place,
where sunlight never pierced, and the roots of trees were
like great ropes; a jungle that stretched for miles and miles
and the tangle in it was so thick that a monkey could barely
get through without squeezing. Deep in the forest there
was a blackness like the blackness of night. The trunks
of the trees were so large that three men holding hands
could not circle them and where there were no trees, there
were vines and snakelike lianas and thorn-bushes and flowers
so great that a man could lie down to sleep in the shade of
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first day the brothers took a great space, piling the
trees at one corner, clearing the tangle and leaving all as
smooth as the water of a lake. They sang as they worked,
and they sang as they rested in the heat of the day, and the
organ bird and the flute bird answered them from the gold-green
shade. So pleasant was their music that the old
iguana, though he was as big as a man, came from his resting
place in the trees to listen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing how things were going, old Hunbatz in the dark
of the forest grew very angry, fearing that his hiding place
would soon dwindle and vanish. So he went to the great
gray owl, his friend, and they talked the matter over between
them. The owl told Hunbatz that he must set the
father’s heart against the brothers, telling him that the boys
were lazy and instead of working spent their time in playing
with the ball and in singing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go,” said the owl, “to their father, and when he asks
how the lads fare with their work, say to him:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>They sing and they play</p>
<p class='line0'>For half of the day.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>It may fall out that he will grow angry and cut off their
heads, and thus the forest will be safe for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That seemed to the wizard to be good advice, and before
the close of the day’s work, old Hunbatz, who could fly by
flapping his hands in a certain way like a swimmer, cast
himself into the air and flew with great swiftness to the
place where the father lived. But he took care to dress
himself like a woodman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well met,” said the father, seeing Hunbatz, but thinking
him no wizard of course. “From where do you come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the other side of the forest,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then perchance you saw my two sons who are clearing
the forest,” said the father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did,” said Hunbatz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how are the boys doing?” asked the father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that old Hunbatz shook his head sadly and answered,
as the owl had told him:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“They sing and they play</p>
<p class='line0'>For half of the day.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>That, you know, was quite untrue, for while they sang,
there was no stopping of work, and as for the play, it is true
that they threw the ball from one to the other, but so clever
were they that one would throw the ball so high that it
would take hours and hours before it came down again, and
of course, while it was in the air, the brothers went on working.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would cut off their heads to teach them a lesson,” said
Hunbatz, “if they were sons of mine.” Then he turned on
his heel and went away, not flying until he was out of the
father’s sight, for he did not wish any man to know that he
was a wizard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be sure, the good man was grieved and his face
clouded, when he heard the tale of Hunbatz, but he said
nothing, and, a short time after, the brothers came home.
He was much surprised when, asking the lads how much
work they had done that day, they told him that they had
cleared off the space of forest he had bidden them to. After
much thought he told them that the next day they would
have to do twice as much as before. The brothers thought
the new task hard, but they went to work with a good will
and on the second day the trees fell like corn before a man
with a machete, and before night they had finished that
which they had been given to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again old Hunbatz flew through the air to the father and
tried to set him against the boys, and again that night, when
the boys were home, their task was set for the next day twice
as much as the day before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the same the third day, and the fourth, until at last
the boys came to a point where by the mightiest working
they could not move a stick or a blade of grass more. And
yet, because of old Hunbatz, the father set them a task still
greater.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the fifth day things looked very hopeless for the boys,
and their hearts were sad as they looked at the forest and
saw the task that their father had set them to do. They
went to work feeling for the first time it would be impossible
for the sun to go down on their finished task, and the
heart of old Hunbatz was glad. But the birds in the forest
were silent that morning, for they too knew that there were
sad hearts in the brothers. Even the grasshoppers and the
mosquitoes and the bees were still, and as for the boys, not a
note of joy could they raise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then to them came the iguana, wise old lizard who knew
everything that went on in the forest, and as soon as he had
heard what the brothers had to say he smiled and called
on them to listen, after making sure that there was no living
creature to hear except the birds, for of them he had no fear,
knowing that the birds tell no secrets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be cheerful,” said the iguana, “and I will tell you a
charm. It is this: mark about the handles of your working
tools rings of black, white, red, and green, and before you
start to work, sing:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I must do what I can,</p>
<p class='line0'>Is the thought of a man,</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>and if your hearts are brave, you will see what happens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having said this and smiled on the brothers, the old
iguana climbed into a tree and stretched himself along the
branch of it where he could best see, and the birds gathered
in a great circle, a matchless melody going up to the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the brothers took their axes, their spades, their hoes,
and their machetes, and painted about the handles of them
rings of black and of white and of red and of green, and
their voices rang sweet and clear as they sang, as the iguana
had told them:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I must do what I can,</p>
<p class='line0'>Is the thought of a man.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had the last words passed than the whole company
of birds broke out into a chorus, singing, chattering,
chirping, whistling, screaming, each according to its manner
and, without hands touching them, axes went to work
cutting down trees, machetes chopped at lianas and vines,
spades cleared and dug; and trees, bushes, and weeds piled
themselves in great heaps at the edge of the clearing, so that
in less than an hour the whole task was done. Then it was
that all things in the forest were glad and the good iguana
smiled broadly. The very monkeys joined in and, catching
the ball which the brothers threw, tossed it from tree to tree
until it passed through the whole jungle and back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But old Hunbatz was angry beyond measure, so angry
that he whirled about on his heels three hundred times,
turning so rapidly that he looked like a storm cloud, and his
long whiskers were tangled about him like a mantle. But
the faster he whirled, the more his anger boiled, and, flapping
his hands, he shot into the air, going so swiftly that
his very clothes were scorched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are the boys?” asked the father, when Hunbatz
stood before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For answer, Hunbatz screamed: “Your boys are idle fellows!</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>They sing and they play</p>
<p class='line0'>For half of the day.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Had I such sons, I would cut their heads off to teach them a
lesson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Said the father: “To-morrow I shall go to the forest, and
if you have not spoken truth, then this arrow which has
never yet missed a mark shall find one in your heart. But
if it is as you say, then my sons shall feel my anger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Hunbatz did not like that at all, for well he knew
that the hunter’s arrows were never wasted. So back he
flew to the owl and the two of them whispered together.
That night there was a great gathering of the animals: of
the hare, the deer, the rat, the jaguar, the puma, the opossum,
and many others. The rat, the deer, and the rabbit
led them, and in a wonderfully short time, not only were all
things restored and the work of the day undone, but the
trees and the bushes and the vines and the lianas that had
been moved on the other days were put back in their old
places, growing and blooming, so that all was as though the
brothers had never been at the forest at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sad was the hour the next morning when the hunter came
with his two sons and saw the forest as though hand had
never touched it. The brothers could not believe their
eyes. Grinning from the thick of a rubber tree was the
face of Hunbatz, and on his shoulder was the owl. For a
moment the father thought to cut off the heads of the lads
to teach them a lesson, but on second thought he told them
that he would give them another chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What should have been done is not done,” he said. “I
will grant you a day and a night to clear all the forest as
you told me it was cleared. To-morrow morning I will
come again, and see whether all is well done.” At that he
left them and went his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had he gone than the two brothers went to see
the iguana, who told them of the witchery of the owl and
Hunbatz and bade them to act as before. So they made
the ring about the handles of their working tools once more
and sang:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I must do what I can,</p>
<p class='line0'>Is the thought of a man,”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>and, as on the day before, axes, machetes, and spades went
to work and in a short time all was clear again. Then the
iguana told the brothers of the evil that Hunbatz had done
and bade them set traps and keep watch that night. So
three traps were made and set, and when night fell, from all
parts of the forest there came animals led by the rat, the
deer, and the rabbit, and old Hunbatz and the owl watched
from the dark caves of the leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had the first three animals stepped into the
clearing than they were caught fast in the traps, whereupon
the rest of the animals turned and fled. Then the brothers
rushed to the traps. The rabbit gave a great jump when he
felt the jaws close upon his beautiful catlike tail, but it was
chopped off close to the body. The deer, with his tail like
a plume, fared no better. So both deer and rabbit fled to
the woods ashamed, and, as you see for yourself, have had
no tails ever since. As for the rat, he was far too wise to
jump as the rabbit and deer had done. But seeing the
brothers coming, he pulled and pulled and pulled so that
all the beautiful hair was stripped, leaving him with but a
bare and ugly thing of a tail as you see to-day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning when the hunter-father came, there
was the forest cleared and all in good order as the boys had
said. So he sought out old Hunbatz, who flapped his hands
and flew for very fear. But so fast he went that his clothes
were burnt off, and his skin was baked into a hard crust by
the great heat, and he fell to the earth and so became what
we call an armadillo. As for the two brothers, they lived
very happily for many, many years, and things went well
with them and the land they lived in was a land of good
harvest and fruit trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So now you know the Tale of Three Tails and if you do
not believe it, look at the rat and the deer and the rabbit
and the armadillo, and see for yourself.</p>

</div>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>THE MAGIC DOG</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/D.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='D'/>OWN where the forest is so thick that the sun
rarely pierces the leafy roof, where there are
mosses and ferns and little plants of the brightest
green, where parrots screech and thousands of little monkeys
chatter in the trees, there stands a great white temple.
Once, long ago, there was joy and gladness there, and
flower-crowned people danced and sang, but now vines hang
about the doors and window holes and there are tall rank
weeds in the courtyard. Still, it is even now very beautiful,
though sad to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long years before this temple was built, there lived a
king, and his people loved him, and he on his part loved
not only his people, but every flower that grew, every grass
blade and every leaf on bush and tree. Where he came
from, none knew, but there were those who said that he had
come from the sea, not in a ship with men, but alone, in a
great and beautiful sea-shell. So they called him, in their
own tongue, The King Who Came in a Sea-shell. And
when he went about among his people he wore a headdress
of gold-green feathers, a feather cloak of turquoise blue,
and about his middle was a golden belt set with glittering
precious stones. On his feet were golden sandals and in
his hand he bore a great spear of silver. The spear he
carried for a sign only, for there was no fighting in those
days, and it was a time when all went very well. Every
one had enough to eat and to drink and to wear, so that
none had to worry about the day to come. Men loved
diamonds and emeralds and rubies for their beauty, and
just as they loved the sight of the tiny rainbow in a sparkling
dew drop. As for other things, corn grew so large that a
single ear was as much as a man could carry and cotton
grew not only white, as we see it now, but red and blue and
yellow and scarlet and black and orange and violet and
green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the daughter of the Sea-shell King who had taught
the people how to grow coloured cotton, and she, with her
silky cloud of hair, was the most beautiful creature ever
seen. When she walked about, the air was sweet with wonderful
perfume, birds sang with joy as though their
throats would burst, and slim drooping ferns nodded a welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story of the beauty and goodness of the maiden ran
through all the land, and young men who sought her hand
came from far and wide. So many were her suitors that a
day was set apart each week, when all the people gathered
to see the young men display their powers or their gifts or
their clevernesses. Some would shoot with the bow and
others cast the lasso. Singers sang the songs they had made
and musicians played their flutes so well that the slender
boughs bent to listen. There were gifts, too, and some
brought rare stones cut into the shapes of birds and animals
and flowers, but not one man had touched the heart of the
princess, though she was gracious to all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now before the king came, an evil creature of a witch
had ruled the land, and she had come from the Land of the
Shaking Mud. Somehow, the Sea-shell King had driven
her away and, that she should worry his people no more,
he had set a boundary, and guards were on watch day and
night to prevent her in her mischief. So she spent the day
in her cave, coming out only at night to prowl about the
boundary, and then only when there was no moon. Her
name was Tlapa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day there came to the king a man in rags, who said
that his name was Maconahola, and the king was glad to
see him, the more so because age was creeping upon the
king, and he sought someone wise and brave enough to rule
in his place. But no sooner had the princess looked at the
stranger than she cast down her eyes, saying that he had the
face of the man she had seen in a dream. When the king
asked her questions, she said that in her dream she had followed
the stranger about, had slept at his feet, had tended
his fields and made his clothes. At that her father was
greatly astonished, for that his daughter should be the
servant of a man who came clad in rags seemed strange
indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second day, Maconahola was asked if he bore gifts,
but he showed his empty hands. Then, to the end that no
idle or useless man should be in that land, a time was set
and Maconahola was ordered to appear before the young
men and compete with them. At the test Maconahola
stood very well. When the best bowman sent his arrow into
the exact centre of the mark, Maconahola drew his bow
and aimed so carefully that his arrow split the arrow of
the other man. Nor was he less skilful with the lasso, casting
his loop so that it fell about the smallest thing aimed at.
It was much the same when the swiftest runner was brought.
To be sure, he ran like a deer, but Maconahola ran like the
wind, leaving him far behind. As for the singing contest,
when the stranger sang the very birds were hushed and, the
song being finished, a great quetzal with jet-black wings, a
scarlet breast, and head and back of gold-green feathers,
flew down and sat on the shoulder of Maconahola.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a great shout went up, and all the bowmen, the lasso
throwers, the runners, and the singers came forward and
greeted Maconahola, for there was no jealousy in that land,
nor was there envy, and each had it in his mind to strive
for that which seemed best, caring nothing for self-advancement.
As for the king, being very old and tired, he was
glad indeed to find a man who might become ruler in his
place. So he stepped down from his high place and cast
his coat made of a thousand turquoise feathers about the
stranger’s shoulders. All went very well indeed, and the
princess was happy to have found the man of her dreams,
and the two of them loved all things, so that all things embraced
and loved them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tlapa, the witch with long crooked nails and black
teeth and ice-like eyes, learned of all this from the bats.
Loving evil, and war, and violence, she was angry that another
should come into the land to rule when the old king
died, for she had long waited for the breath to pass from
his body so that she might rule again. Seeing how the
people greeted Maconahola, she became tight-lipped and
slit-eyed. One night she went to Roraima, a place of rocks,
where lived a wild man of terrible strength who sat in his
cave all day, crouched over a fire of smoking green wood.
Over the cave fire Tlapa and the wild man whispered long
and long, while bats flapped and fluttered and white worms
crawled close to listen, for they plotted how to dispose of
Maconahola. The wild man was all for dashing into the
country, trampling down the guards that stood in his way,
and beating the stranger with his great club of long, blunt
thorns. But that Tlapa would not hear of, knowing that
Maconahola could shoot an arrow that would speedily put
an end to the wild man of the rocks. Far more crafty was
she, remembering and telling the wild man of a strange
plant that grew in the gloomy depths of a forest far away,
where, because of the tangled thicket, she could never go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had the wild man learnt of the strange plant
than he sprang to his feet and with great bounds went crashing
through the forest, overturning trees that stood in his
way, upsetting huge rocks, splashing through swamps, and
climbing a rocky precipice like a wild cat until he came to
the place where grew the evil weed. He was back again
in his cave before midnight. Taking the weed, Tlapa dried
it over a fire of rotten wood and crushed it into powder.
The powder she cast into the air and, carried by the wind,
it fell where the king’s people lived. Wherever it fell,
wherever it touched, there grew hate and suspicion, jealousy
and greed. Where the dust fell on plant or flower, though
there was but the slightest fleck of it, there was immediately
a withering and a dying; the very corn shrivelled and
shrunk. Where had been flowers, there grew in a single
night dense, thorny tangle. The very weather changed and
the pleasant cool passed away, so that the days were hot
and the nights icy cold. Some men, touched with a strange
greed, laid claim to great tracts of earth, bidding others begone,
and so for the first time in that land men quarrelled
and fought. Even the old king changed a little and, seeing
the trouble that had come upon his land, was persuaded
to believe that Maconahola was the cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Word passed from mouth to mouth and whispering
tongues poisoned truth, and when Maconahola took his
walks, grieving to see the withered flowers and fruits, people
hid from his gaze. Thoughts passed to words and
words to deeds, and one day a crowd turned on Maconahola
and with sticks and stones drove him across the border and
into a forest where, except for the cry of a distant bird, it
was still as midnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sad at heart, Maconahola built a little shelter of branches
and leaves and day after day wandered alone. Nor had he
living company until one day there came to him a dog,
footsore and thin. The creature was hungry and weak and
thorn-torn, and Maconahola took it in, washed and tended
it and shared with it his meal. And a poor enough meal it
was being of small berries and drops of tree gum and little
roots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning when he went down to the stream to
bathe, the dog did not follow him, and on his return, to his
vast astonishment, he found in front of his house a field
with growing corn and many food plants. It had grown
up in less than an hour. So that evening he was full of
gladness, and with his dog walked about in full enjoyment
of the beautiful green earth, thankful for the humming bees
and the gentle wind that moved the leaves, thankful for the
only living creature that was with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next day when he returned from his stream, having
left the dog sleeping in the sun, he found that his little
bower of branches and leaves had been transformed to a
house with furnishings all simple, clean, and bright. And
around it were glorious flowers and fruits, and in the trees
birds sang, and humming-birds, looking like flashing emeralds,
darted through the leaves. So again his heart was full
of joy and thankfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third day he made as if to go to the river, but instead
turned and hid himself behind the house to watch.
Then he saw the wonder, for the dog threw off its skin and
there stood the beautiful maiden whom he had known as
the king’s daughter. At once she set about making garments
of coloured cotton for him, and so rapidly she wrought
that they fell from her hands like flower petals. Then she
busied herself weaving a hammock of silk grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maconahola made no sign, but went down to the river as
usual and when he returned the dog ran to meet him, thrusting
its moist nose into his hand. But the next day again
he hid, and again the dog cast off its skin and the princess
went to the garden, and to her came a cloud of humming
birds. Swiftly Maconahola ran to the dogskin, picked it
up and threw it into the fire, where it burned like dry
leaves. Then the princess saw what had been done and
gave a great cry of joy for the spell was broken; and
Maconahola knew a fresh vigour of soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hand in hand, they returned to the land, and the old
king seeing them coming went out to meet them. And all
the people were with him, overjoyed that Maconahola had
returned, seeing the evil that had come upon them had not
been removed with his departure. Overjoyed, too, were
they to see the princess again, for none knew to what place
she had gone, knowing only that she had vanished one
evening, and at the same time a dog had run swiftly through
their midst. For certainly, Tlapa the witch had laid some
enchantment upon her with evil design. But evil, though it
may touch the good, cannot for ever bind it, wherefore the
maiden resumed her own form some part of every day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a great meeting of all the people then, and
Maconahola lost no time in seeking out the witch Tlapa,
whom he killed with a silver pointed arrow shot through
her heart. As for the wild man of Roraima, it is said that
learning of the death of the witch, he dashed away in great
terror and, sinking in the Shaking Mud, was seen no more.
But the King of the Sea-shell made Maconahola a ruler,
and on the spot where the bower had been built and where
he first saw the dog there was erected the temple of white
stone which you may see for yourself to this day if you go
to Orinoco.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>THE CALABASH MAN</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/T.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='T'/>HERE was once a woman who had an only son,
and they lived in great contentment in a little house
by the side of the lake and at the foot of a mountain.
If you go to Guiana, you may see both lake and
mountain to this day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all that land there was no lad so straight, so tall, so
graceful as Aura, and, what is better still, he was kind and
gentle. At the close of the day when he came from his
fishing, he and his mother would sit in the cool of the
evening, watching the glory of the sunset and listening to
the music of the silver cascade which fell from the mountain
into the lake. Often the forest animals would come
and play about before their house. The lively little agouti
would sport with the black jaguar and the great armadillo
would let the coral snake coil on his shell, while birds of
wondrous beauty flashed through the leaves of the trees like
living fire. Great butterflies with silky white and green
wings fluttered about the flowers showing their beauty, and
from them the old mother learned the way to weave bright
designs into the hammocks that she made of silk grass.
At such times, before the sun dropped into its purple bed of
cloud, and before the million glowworms lit their lights, the
queen ant would sing:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“From forest and hill</p>
<p class='line0'>We come at your will.</p>
<p class='line0'>Call, Aura, call!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>All went very well until one day Aura, going to the lake,
found his basket net broken and torn, and taking it from
the water saw with surprise that the fish which had been in
it were eaten. Such a thing had never happened before,
for in forest and hill he knew no enemy. As he stood in
wonderment, the torn basket in his hand, he heard a voice
behind him say:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“From forest and hill</p>
<p class='line0'>We come at your will.</p>
<p class='line0'>Call, Aura, call!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Looking around he saw a woodpecker, and the bright beady
eyes of the bird were looking at him. Thereupon, Aura
told the woodpecker to watch well, and setting a new basket
net in the water he went a little way into the forest to
gather wild fruits. Not far had he gone when he heard the
watching woodpecker call, “Toc, Toc!” Swiftly he ran,
but though he sped like a deer he was too late, for the
second basket net was destroyed even more completely than
the first and again the fish were devoured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A third net was set, and this time he called upon the
cuckoo to watch while he gathered his fruits. Very soon
he heard the “Pon, pon!” of his new watcher and Aura
lost no time in running to the lakeside. There in the water
and close to the basket net was the flat, mud-coloured head
of a swamp alligator with its dull and heavy-lidded eyes.
Quick as lightning, Aura fitted an arrow to his bow and let
fly, and the shaft struck the reptile between the eyes. A
moment later the beast disappeared into the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The basket net had been partly broken by the alligator,
but Aura mended it and again entered the forest. But before
long he heard the cuckoo call, and much louder this
time, so he ran like the wind, fitting an arrow to his bow as
he went. On the lake-bank stood a beautiful Indian
maiden in a gown that looked like silver, and she was weeping
bitterly. At that Aura’s heart was touched with pity,
for he could see no living thing unhappy and remain happy
himself. Gently he took her by the hand and asked her to
tell him her name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anu-Anaitu,” she said, and smiled through her tears like
the sun after a summer rain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From where do you come?” was his next question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Far, far away, where the great owl lives,” she made
reply, and pointed in the direction of the dark forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who is your father?” he asked, and at that there was
a ripple of water rings on the lake and Aura thought he
saw the nose of the alligator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she made no answer to his question. Instead, she
covered her face with her hands and bent her head, so that
her hair fell about her like a cloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing her strange grief Aura said no more, but led her
to his mother who received her kindly, and for many months
the three of them dwelt together very happily. Yet whenever
Anaitu thought of her father, she wept bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last there came a day when Aura asked the maiden to
be his wife and told her that if she would give him her hand,
the two of them would make a journey to her own land so
that she might say farewell to her people, telling them that
she had made her home in a land of peace and brightness
with those who loved her. Hearing that, little Anaitu wept
with terror, telling Aura of the fearful journey that would
be theirs, through a place where were great bats and gray
hairy spiders and centipedes, and harmful and fearful
things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then stay with my mother and I shall go alone,” said
Aura, seeing her fear. “And I will seek out your father
and tell him that all is well with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is worse still,” cried the maiden, “for there is an
evil spirit in my land and my father is bewitched. Seeing
you, he will destroy you and your mother and me as well,
once he learns where we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Greatly puzzled with all this, Aura went to see a wise
old hermit who lived at the end of the lake, and to him he
told his troubles and fears. After much thought, the hermit
told Aura that he would make his journey in safety if he
feared not and carried himself like a man. “And,” said
he, “if it should come to pass that you are offered the choice
of things, see to it that you choose the simplest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than that the wise man would not say, so Aura went
home and straightway prepared his canoe, persuaded
Anaitu to go with him, and presently they set off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The way was fearful enough, as the maiden had said, for
much of it was through dark forests and between high river
banks where the tree roots reached out black and twisted
like evil serpents. Again, they had to pass through swamps
where alligators slept and strange yellow beasts with heads
large as houses lay hidden. And for many long hours they
wound in and out of tangled jungles where the sun never
shone and in the depths of which were strange things that
roared so that the very trees trembled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After many days they came to a smooth stretch of sand,
and then the maiden told him that they had arrived in the
land of her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now I must leave you,” she said, “but my mother
will come and offer you one of three things. See to it, dear
Aura, that you choose wisely, for all depends upon your
choice.” At that she waved him a farewell and went up
the bank and so passed from his sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before long there came down the bank a wrinkled old
woman with sorrowful eyes, and she bore three gourds.
Setting them down by the side of the canoe, she bade Aura
choose one. On the top of one gourd was a cover of gold,
on the second a cover of silver, and on the third a cover of
clay. Lifting the covers, Aura saw in the first fresh blood.
In the gourd with the silver top he saw flesh, and in the
third, a piece of cassava bread. Aura bore in mind the
words of the old hermit and quickly chose the gourd that
held the bread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have done well,” said the old woman. “This is a
land where men believe in gold alone, and much blood is
spilled because of it. Far better is it that men should
choose that which is in the earth. Now having so chosen,
I will lead you to my husband, whose name is Kaikoutji.
But here cruelty reigns everywhere and he may tear you to
pieces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aura had no mind to do otherwise than go through with
his task and so told the old woman. Whereupon she led
him to the top of the bank, where he again saw his Anaitu,
and the maiden and her mother hid Aura in a forest near
the house, while they went in to prepare Kaikoutji for the
visit. Hearing that the young man who loved his daughter
was near, the old man fell into a most marvellous rage and
so great was his anger that he rushed out and bent trees as
though they were reeds and bit rocks as a man bites a crust
of bread. So there was much trouble before he was persuaded
to see the gentle Aura. Even then, Anaitu begged
Aura to return, but he threw his arms around her and was
gone before she could say a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange things happened as he ran to the house. Great
branches broke and fell without hands touching them and
stones leaped from the earth and whizzed close to his ears,
but he hastened on and entered into a hall. Kaikoutji was
not there; but as Aura looked round, he came in running.
The bewitched old man was strangely decked out with bones
and teeth which dangled at the ends of strings fastened to his
arms and legs and his head was covered with a great calabash
painted green, in the front of which were two holes
pierced, through which he looked. For a moment Kaikoutji
stood, then giving a terrible howl he began to leap
about, waving his arms and rattling the dangling bones and
teeth—a very painful sight to Aura. The howling the man
made was terrible. After much of this he stopped, turning
the holes of his calabash on Aura.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can you do?” he yelled. “What can you do?
Can you bend trees? Can you bite rocks? Can you leap
like this?” Again he commenced to dance up and down,
each leap being higher than the one before it, so that at last
his calabash struck the roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had quieted down again, Aura said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot leap. I cannot bend trees and I cannot bite
rocks as you do. But I can work with my hands and make
whatever you wish made.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that, Kaikoutji whirled about and gave three
mighty leaps, rattling his bones and dangling teeth furiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make me a magic stool,” he shouted. “And carve it of
wood, with the head of a jaguar at one end and my head
carved at the other. And see to it that you have it finished
by sunrise, or else you die.” Then he gave a yell, whirled
about and rushed from the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aura saw that the task would be hard, even if he did
what he had been set to do in the quiet of his own home.
But without having seen the face of Kaikoutji he wondered
greatly how he would complete his work. For all that he
took his knife, selected a block of wood and went to work,
and he worked with such a will that by midnight he had
it all finished but the rough place at the end where was to
appear the likeness of Kaikoutji. So he went to the old
wife who had brought him the gourds and begged her to
describe the features of her husband. But that she refused
to do, saying that if she did so, Kaikoutji, who knew everything,
being an enchanted man, would kill them all. An
hour passed and everything was the same, Aura’s work unfinished,
his will as strong as ever. Then to him came the
gentle maiden who took him by the hand and led him into
another chamber where the old man sat in a corner asleep,
his green calabash over his head. In another corner of the
room was a hammock and into that Aura crept, thinking
that if he kept quiet and remained hidden, by some chance
the calabash might fall off and the face of the man be seen.
But after looking long and seeing no move on the part of the
sleeping man, he grew weak and weary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the corner near him came a small voice which
said:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“From forest and hill</p>
<p class='line0'>We come at your will.</p>
<p class='line0'>Call, Aura, call!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>and looking that way he saw a mouse. At that the heart of
Aura was glad, the more as he saw the mouse run to the
sleeping man and begin to nibble at his hand. For a moment
it looked as if Kaikoutji would take off his calabash,
for he was plainly annoyed. But instead, by chance, he
set his hand on the mouse, caught it, and flung it to the end
of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again a voice was heard and this time Aura saw a
spider dropping from the ceiling, and as it dropped it said:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“From forest and hill</p>
<p class='line0'>We come at your will.</p>
<p class='line0'>Call, Aura, call!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Over to the sleeper ran the spider, but matters were no
better than before, for Kaikoutji dropped his hand, caught
the spider, and threw it after the mouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had Kaikoutji fallen asleep again than there
came into the room ants by hundreds and thousands, and
leading them was the queen ant who sang:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“From forest and hill</p>
<p class='line0'>We come at your will.</p>
<p class='line0'>Call, Aura, call!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Like little soldiers they marched on the sleeper, swarming
over his hands, his body, his legs. Under the calabash they
went, a half hundred of them. That was too much even for
Kaikoutji, and he leaped to his feet, dashed the calabash to
the earth, and fell to brushing off the ants in lively manner.
But the calabash was broken to pieces by the force of the
fall, and for the rest of that night he slept with his face
exposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From his hiding place it did not take long for Aura to
learn his ugly features. Nor did it escape his notice that
between the eyes was an arrow mark, and by that he knew
that Kaikoutji was also the alligator he had shot in the lake.
When he was sure that the old man was asleep, he slipped
out quietly and went to his work, and with such spirit he
wrought that before sunrise he had carved the face on the
end of the stool. Better still, so exact was his work, that
all who saw it knew the face of Kaikoutji the terrible.
But when the old man saw it and noted the arrow mark between
the eyes, he leaped higher than he had ever leaped
before, having no calabash to hinder him, and declared that
the task had been too easy and that another must be done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Build me,” he said, “a house of feathers before sundown,
and see to it that there is no bird in the forest from
which there is not a feather taken.” Then, giving strict
orders that no one should enter the part of the forest in
which Aura was put, he leaped up and down several times,
screaming horribly, after which he hastened away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When all was quiet, Aura lifted his head and sang:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“From forest and hill</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, come. ’Tis my will.</p>
<p class='line0'>I call. I call.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Then there was a great rushing sound and from everywhere
came birds: sea birds and land birds, river birds and lake
birds, birds that flew, ran, and waded. There were sober
brown birds, and birds more glorious than the rainbow.
There was a cloud of humming-birds, glittering like powdered
gold, and there were proud ostriches. Chakars dropped
from the sky singing, and blood-red flamingoes raced
with golden-crested wrens. There were songbirds, and
silent birds, and birds whose cry was like the sound of a
golden bell. There were storks, hawks, vultures, condors,
swans, lapwings, and mocking-birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a moment did they lose. In and out and round about
they went, weaving wonderfully, their busy beaks at work,
and before an hour had passed there stood the most wonderful
house of feathers that the eye of man ever saw. In
the light of the sun it shone green-gold, violet, purple,
brown, white, and scarlet. And when the last feather was
woven the condor called, and the beating of so many wings,
as the birds left, made the very air throb. When all was
again silent it seemed to Aura that the work had been done
in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The minute the sun touched the edge of the world Kaikoutji
came howling and leaping. When he saw the
feather house he stood for a moment with open mouth. So
angry he was at the sight that his tongue was dry and
parched and he could say nothing. But the glory of what
he saw dazzled and blinded him, and with a howl he turned
and plunged into the depths of the forest and was seen no
more. Some say that he was drowned in the Lake of Pitch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Aura and Anaitu lived in the house of feathers and
from that day to this the people of that land have been kind
and gentle and have forgotten the evil days when cruelty
reigned everywhere. Also, they know now that there are
things more glorious than gold.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>NA-HA THE FIGHTER</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/I.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='I'/>N the Far South near Cape Horn there is a place of
many islands, and it is a corner of the world where
winds are piercing cold and great black clouds scurry
across a lead-gray sky. From snowclad mountains slide
rivers of ice from which break off mighty pieces to fall into
the sea with thunder-sounds. It is a land wrinkled into
narrow valleys that are always gloomy and cold and wet.
Cold, ice cold, is the gray-green sea, and the wild cries of
a million sea birds fill the air. Sometimes great albatrosses
sweep up the channels between the high, jagged mountains
or drop low to sail over penguin-crowded rocks, and sometimes
the mountain echoes are deep-toned with the booming
of walrus and the barking of seals. But people are few.
There are Indians there, poor gentle folk who fish in the
sea and who know nothing but a life of cold, and they paddle
or sit crouching in their canoes, taking no heed of the
biting wind and the snow that falls on their naked bodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Travelling in that part of the world, I came upon a boy
who had been left, somehow, on an island not much larger
than a good-sized playground. He must have been there
alone for some months, for he had lived on mussels and
shell-fish, and the empty shells formed a good-sized heap
about his sleeping place. Though I questioned him closely
later, when we came to know one another, I could never
learn how he got there. He was, I suppose, about ten years
old, and certainly bright and intelligent. As for his memory
it was quite remarkable, and he picked up words and
the names of things very rapidly. Altogether, he stayed
with me for three months, and I was often astonished at
the aptness with which he did some things, as, for instance,
the making of an arrow-head from a piece of broken bottle.
But other things he seemed quite unable to do. A knot in
a rope puzzled him sorely and for a long time a belt-buckle
was a deep mystery to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day I found that he was trying to tell me a story
about a seal, for we had seen several that morning. For
awhile I paid no attention, being occupied at something or
other that required care, but soon it dawned on me that he
was very earnest and that the tale was a long one. Fearing
that I had missed much by my preoccupation and carelessness,
I made him tell it to me a second and a third and a
fourth time, and presently made shift to piece things together,
and so get a fair notion of his story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have called the tale by the name of the hero and have
set it down in my own words and as I understood it. Were
I to write it in his words it would go something like this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many day, a far day, under-water man walk water.
Eat man my father’s father; men cry much hard.” There
would have to be indicated, too, much gesticulation and arm
waving by way of illustration and emphasis.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So
here is the tale.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Long years ago, the people of that land were sadly at the
mercy of the wild, hairy folk who lived under the sea. To
be sure, there were long periods when they were left in
peace to do their fishing, though from their canoes they
could look down into the waters and see the under-sea people
walking on the sands at the bottom, very shadowy and
vague, though, in the greenish light. Still, it was clear
enough, for those who watched, to see their hair-covered
bodies, their long and serpent-like arms and their noseless
faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But again, there were times when the under-sea men
marched in great numbers out of the water and caught the
land men, dragging them down to their deaths. In such
numbers they came that there was no resisting them. Nor
was there escape, for the under-sea people could walk on
the water, going faster than the wind itself. With ear-splitting
booming they would form themselves into a wide
circle about the canoes, then draw nearer in wild rushes or
strange slidings and drag the frightened men into the green-gray
water. Sometimes a few only were taken and those
that were left, looking down, might see the under-sea folk
dragging their fellows to great rocks to which they bound
them with ropes of leathery kelp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day the under-sea people caught Na-Ha, a youth
strong as a wild wind, whose muscles were knotted like oak
branches, one who smiled when danger came. Five of the
noseless people attacked him and of the five, Na-Ha sent
three to the bottom of the sea with broken necks, for though
he smote them with his clenched fist alone, they staggered
back and swiftly sank, and the blood that gushed from their
mouths made a spreading pink cloud in the water. But
soon the sea was alive with wild, raging faces and the roaring
of them was like the southeast wind in the forest trees,
yet Na-Ha stood in his little canoe, cold and calm, and the
smile did not leave his lips. Stealthily they crept toward
him, none at first daring to attack, until with a fierce noise
and clamour all rushed together, leaping upon him in his
canoe and bearing it down by sheer press and weight,
Na-Ha in the midst of the tangled mass of hair-covered
creatures. Some who saw that fight said that the sudden
silence when the waters closed over them hurt the ears like
a thunder clap, but the true hearted Na-Ha was the last to
disappear, and while he smote the black-haired ones furiously,
the smile of scorn was still on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a picture in a dream some saw the fight among the
rocks at the bottom of the sea, saw the noseless ones crowding
about the lad, saw others leaping over the heads of those
who did not dare to near him, saw others again creeping in
the sea sand, trailing kelp ropes to bind him. Many fell in
that battle under the sea and the low waves that lapped the
shore were red with blood that day. How it ended none
knew, for with the dying light and the sand clouds that hung
in the water all became gray at last and then swiftly faded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night the land people wept for Na-Ha the untamed,
Na-Ha whose spear was like lightning, Na-Ha whose canoe
rode the waves like the brown storm-birds. Tales were
whispered of how he never bent beneath a load, of how in
the blackest night he drove his boat before the storm, of
how once he swept out to sea after a great whale and slew
it, so that his people were saved from the hunger-death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But with the screaming of the morning sea-gulls Na-Ha
came to them again, walking up out of the sea, and his face
was set and stern. Nor did he say a word until he had eaten
and thought awhile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tale he told was of the under-seas and of his wandering
after the battle in which he left so many dead in
bloody sand. He had been sore-pressed, he said, but had
broken away and come to a door in a cave, which he entered.
It was a vast cavern in which he found himself, so
vast that he could not at first see the end, and the roof of it
he never saw, it being lost in a strange, cool-green light.
The floor of the place was of gold dust and silver sand, and
out of it grew networks of white rocks about which swam
fish of many gay colours, while everywhere seaweeds
swayed in gently moving water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon he came to a place where, on a seat of white, sat a
woman with bent head, and she was fair of skin and her
golden hair floated in the water like a cloud. Being bidden,
Na-Ha told her the tale of the fight and how the earth people
were woe-ridden because of the evil work of the under-sea
folk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patiently she listened, her cheek on her hand and her eyes
large with grief, and when Na-Ha had done she told him
that there was but one way to free his people and that was
the way of the white death. Much more she told him and
then gave him a great sea-shell and made him know that
when he blew it the great cold that lies under the seven
stars would be freed and the under-sea people driven for all
time to their own place. Then she stepped from her seat,
and taking Na-Ha by the hand gazed at him long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many there are, Na-Ha, who live not to know of the
good that they do. He who looses the white death must
himself be stilled. This I tell you, Na-Ha, lest your heart
fail you,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was all, for he did not tell the tale of how he came
again to the land, but he showed them the great shell and
said that his mind was made up to free his own people,
though he himself slept the sleep. At that the people set
up a great shout and there were not wanting those who
offered to sound the blast, saying that it were better for
Na-Ha to lead the people. But that Na-Ha refused, and
added that the under-sea woman had told him that before
the blast was blown all the land people should take themselves
and their belongings to a far land under the sun, for
staying where they were, it would do but small good to
drive the under-sea people to their own place for ever,
seeing that they themselves must also be ice-stiffened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then arose a confusion of talk, many being unwilling to
leave the land where their fathers and the fathers of their
fathers had lived, but Na-Ha prevailed and overruled
them, and soon the day came when there was a great movement
and canoes were loaded and the land people set off
for the country under the sun. So Na-Ha was left alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the length and the breadth of the land Na-Ha
walked, to see if by mischance some had been left, but there
were none. And when the sea-hen and the albatross and
the gull and the brown storm-birds saw the hair-covered,
noseless people come out of the sea, when with the black
loneliness of night the snow came and the land waters were
prisoned under glassy ice, when the morning sun looked on
a world of rime and crystal frost, then Na-Ha put the great
shell to his lips and blew a blast that woke the echoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the world soon grew faint and sleepy and all living
creatures except the noseless ones fled or flew after the land
people, and there was strange stillness everywhere. Trees
that had been green grew horned and black and then ghost-white.
And the black wind came raging and furious, and
grinding, groaning ice-mountains swam in the sea and
locked the land, and hills were cased in beryl walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing all that, for a time the under-sea folk were full
of delight, believing themselves to be masters of the land,
but soon they feared the glistening white of the world, the
black scurrying clouds, and the fast-thickening ice. So
they sought the sea, but no sea was there, only thick-ribbed
ice across which swept snow-laden, stinging winds, and instead
of the quiet of the under-water there was the calm of
the white death. Under the eaves of the rocks they
crouched, but it was small help, for with the biting cold they
shrivelled and shrank. Close they hugged themselves,
their elbows thrust into their hairy sides, their legs bent,
making themselves small. And thus they stayed, nevermore
to be as they were. For in that great cold the under-water
people became seals, and seals they remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well and bravely stood Na-Ha while all this came to
pass, scornful of the death that clawed at him. Nor did he
lay down to die until the great cold had passed away and his
people returned to find the under-water folk forevermore
bound to their own place, powerless to harm, looking always
with wide, wondering eyes, lest the mighty Na-Ha again
steal upon them and bring the great white death.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>THE HUMMING-BIRD AND THE FLOWER</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/G.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='G'/>OOD morning, pretty flower!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, little humming-bird!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I have some honey, please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. Here is plenty. Help yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. It is very good of you. Is there anything
that I can do for you in return?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I hear so little, seeing that I do not go abroad, that
I love to be told things. I wish that you would tell me how
you came to have so beautiful a dress. I have often wondered
as I saw you flashing past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you indeed? Well, let me think. I believe I
have heard that it was because of a mouse, that I have it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A mouse? How can that be, busy little Colibrí? A
mouse, you know, is dull and gray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, Florecilla, if it was not a mouse, it was mud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear humming-bird, you <span class='it'>must</span> be wrong. You
know as well as I do that mud is dull and gray. Won’t
you stop your humming a moment and think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, now I know. It was because of a panther.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, dear Colibrí, that is worse still. A panther, did
you say? I must have heard wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that right, either? Well, it must have been all
three—the mouse, the mud, and the panther. So there
now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But how sweet this honey is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, I am glad that you find it so. But please tell
me about your pretty dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. I forgot, thinking of the honey. One has so
much to think of. I remember now, perfectly well. It
was Paloma the dove who told me all about it yesterday, but
a day and a night is a very, very long time to remember a
long tale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then tell me before you forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, once all humming-birds were gray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I have heard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, a big panther was going through the woods very
quietly, and he stepped on a mouse-nest and happened to
kill all the baby mice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me. I am so sorry to hear that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So when the mother mouse came to her home and saw
what had happened she was very much annoyed, saying that
the panther was too big and too clumsy and did not look
where he was going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Colibrí, she would be annoyed. You know I have
often thought how nice it would be if mice and panthers
and all creatures did not move about as they do. They
run about so and they jump and skip, and it is no wonder
that things happen. Suppose trees and flowers and bushes
were as restless as animals. Think how it would be with
great trees treading on little flowers, and thorn-bushes running
about and tearing down the gentle flores del aire and
scratching the tender skins of the grapes. Now if <span class='it'>I</span> were
queen, I would make a law so that all those forest creatures
that run on four legs should just stand and grow as we do,
and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please do not interrupt or I may forget the tale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I beg your pardon. Go on, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course the panther told the mother mouse how
it had happened and said that he was sorry and that he
would be more careful, but she scolded him and kept it in
her heart to punish him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, little Colibrí, if he said that he was sorry, and if it
could not be helped, then it seems to me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, little flower, you <span class='it'>must</span> listen. You have no idea
how difficult it is to tell a tale. So please do not interrupt.
One day when the panther was asleep the mouse crept up
with some gum which she had taken from the tree and
sealed up the panther’s eyes. Then she took mud from the
laguna and plastered it over the gum, and then more gum
and more mud, so that the panther could not tell day from
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me. That was very unkind and very dreadful. I
am as sorry for the panther as I am for the mother mouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyway, that proves that it was a mouse and a
panther and mud, just as I said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, dear humming-bird, how about the dress of many
colours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am coming to that, but you interrupt so. The panther
roared and roared and roared, until the very softest of
his roars shook the esteros, and the alligators were frightened
and dived to the bottom of the water. Hearing all
that noise, a humming-bird asked the panther what the noise
was all about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was very good of the humming-bird. And what
did the panther say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He told the humming-bird all about it and asked him
to kill the mouse. But that the humming-bird would not
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not. <span class='it'>I</span> never killed a mouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So then the panther said that if the humming-bird would
take away the gum and the mud so that he could see again,
he would do anything that he could in return. You see,
little flower, the panther is wise because he travels so much
and all things that travel know a great deal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not so sure of that, Colibrí. All this summer I
have travelled up this tree and so have gone a great distance,
but I know very little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is different. No one wants a flower to be wise.
To be beautiful is enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But please listen and do not talk so much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very sorry that I interrupted you, little humming-bird.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the humming-bird told the panther that she wished
to have a beautiful dress, as beautiful as the dress of the sun
bird, and asked him to tell her where she could get bright
colours. Then before the panther answered, she asked
him to tell her how the lianas got the red and yellow and
purple for their blossoms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the most interesting thing I have ever heard and
I hope the tale will not be short. Did the panther know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course he knew. He told her that the flowers got
their colour from the earth and he also told her where there
was clay of many colours and where there were gold and
silver and rubies. So the humming-bird picked and
picked until the panther’s eyes were unsealed and the big
fellow gave a roar of gladness. All that day panther and
humming-bird worked, bringing coloured clay and coloured
sands, and silver and gold, and rubies and opals, and the
blue and crimson of sunset and the silver of the moon and
the stars, and the tender green of shady forests and the blackness
of ebony. Out of all these the humming-bird dressed
herself, and for misty-moving wings she took the spun silk
of the spider and the soft thread of the sumaha. And that
is how the humming-bird got her dress. There now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad to know that, dear humming-bird, and I thank
you for telling me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I, dear flower, thank you for the honey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, then, if you must go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Florecilla.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'><span class='bold'>B-z-z-z-z. H-m-m-m-m-m—mmmmmm.</span></span>”</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>THE MAGIC BALL</h1></div>

<h3><span style='font-size:smaller'>(A Tale of the Chuput Country)</span></h3>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/A.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='A'/> COLD-EYED witch lived in the Cordilleras and
when the first snow commenced to fall she was
always full of glee, standing on a rock, screaming
like a wind-gale and rubbing her hands. For it pleased
her to see the winter moon, the green country blotted out,
the valleys white, the trees snow-laden, and the waters ice-bound
and black. Winter was her hunting time and her
eating time, and in the summer she slept. So she was full
of a kind of savage joy when there were leaden clouds and
drifting gales, and she waited and watched, waited and
watched, ever ready to spring upon frost-stiffened creatures,
that went wandering down to the warmer lowlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This witch was a wrinkled creature, hard of eye, thin-lipped,
with hands that looked like roots of trees, and so
tough was her skin that knife could not cut nor arrow pierce
it. In the country that swept down to the sea she was
greatly feared, and hated, too. The hate came because by
some strange magic she was able to draw children to her
one by one, and how she did it no man knew. But the
truth is that she had a magic ball, a ball bright and shining
and of many colours, and this she left in places where children
played, but never where man or woman could see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, near the lake called Oretta, a brother and sister
were at play and saw the magic ball at the foot of a little
hill. Pleased with its brightness and beauty Natalia ran
to it, intending to pick it up and take it home, but, to her
surprise, as she drew near to it the ball rolled away; then, a
little way off, came to rest again. Again she ran to it and
almost had her hand on it when it escaped, exactly as a piece
of thistle-down does, just as she was about to grasp it. So
she followed it, always seeming to be on the point of catching
it but never doing so, and as she ran her brother Luis
followed, careful lest she should come to harm. The
strange part of it was that every time the ball stopped it
rested close to some berry bush or by the edge of a crystal-clear
spring, so that she, like all who were thus led away,
always found at the moment of resting something to eat or
to drink or to refresh herself. Nor, strangely enough, did
she tire, but because of the magic went skipping and running
and jumping just as long as she followed the ball.
Nor did any one under the spell of that magic note the
passing of time, for days were like hours and a night like the
shadow of a swiftly flying cloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, chasing the ball, Natalia and Luis came to a place
in the valley where the Rio Chico runs between great hills,
and it was dark and gloomy and swept by heavy gray clouds.
The land was strewn with mighty broken rocks and here
and there were patches of snow, and soon great snow flakes
appeared in the air. Then boy and girl were terror-struck,
for they knew with all the wandering and twisting
and turning they had lost their way. But the ball still
rolled on, though slower now, and the children followed.
But the air grew keener and colder and the sun weaker, so
that they were very glad indeed when they came to a black
rock where, at last, the ball stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Natalia picked it up, and for a moment gazed at its
beauty, but for a moment only. For no sooner had she
gazed at it and opened her lips to speak than it vanished as
a soap bubble does, at which her grief was great. Luis
tried to cheer her and finding that her hands were icy cold
led her to the north side of the rock where it was warmer,
and there he found a niche like a lap between two great
arms, and in the moss-grown cranny Natalia coiled herself
up and was asleep in a minute. As for Luis, knowing that
as soon as his sister had rested they must set out about finding
a way home, he sat down intending to watch. But not
very long did he keep his eyes open, for he was weary and
sad at heart. He tried hard to keep awake, even holding
his eyelids open with his fingers, and he stared hard at a
sunlit hilltop across the valley, but even that seemed to make
him sleepy. Then, too, there were slowly nodding pine
trees and the whispering of leaves, coming in a faint murmur
from the mountainside. So, soon, Luis slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Natalia, being out of the blustering wind, was very comfortable
in the little niche between the great stone arms,
and she dreamed that she was at home. Her mother, she
thought, was combing her hair and singing as she did so.
So she forgot her hunger and weariness, and in her dream-land
knew nothing of the bare black rocks and snow-patched
hills. Instead, she seemed to be at home where the warm
firelight danced on the walls and lighted her father’s brown
face to a lively red as he mended his horse gear. She saw
her brother, too, with his jet-black hair and cherry-red lips.
But her mother, she thought, grew rough and careless and
pulled her hair, so that she gave a little cry of pain and
awoke. Then in a flash she knew where she was and was
chilled to the bone with the piercing wind that swept down
from the mountain top. Worse still, in front of her stood
the old witch of the hills, pointing, pointing, pointing with
knotty forefinger, and there were nails on her hands and
feet that looked like claws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Natalia tried to rise, but could not, and her heart was
like stone when she found what had happened. It was this:
while she slept, the witch had stroked and combed her hair,
and meanwhile wrought magic, so that the girl’s hair was
grown into the rock so very close that she could not as much
as turn her head. All that she could do was to stretch forth
her arms, and when she saw Luis a little way off she called
to him most piteously. But good Luis made no move. Instead,
he stood with arms wide apart like one who feels a
wall in the dark, moving his hands this way and that. Then
Natalia wept, not understanding and little knowing that
the witch had bound Luis with a spell, so that there seemed
to be an invisible wall around the rock through which he
could not pass, try as he would. But he heard the witch
singing in her high and cracked voice, and this is what she
sang:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Valley all pebble-sown,</p>
<p class='line0'>Valley where wild winds moan!</p>
<p class='line0'>Come, mortals, come.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Valley so cool and white,</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Straight like a shaft to mark,</p>
<p class='line0'>Come they to cold and dark,</p>
<p class='line0'>Children of men!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Then she ceased and stood with her root-like finger up-raised,
and from near by came the voice of a great white
owl, which took up the song, saying:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Things of the dark and things without name,</p>
<p class='line0'>Save us from light and the torch’s red flame.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Now all this was by starlight, but the moment the owl
had ceased, from over the hill came a glint of light as the
pale moon rose, and with a sound like a thunderclap the
witch melted into the great rock and the owl flapped away
heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother,” whispered the girl, “you heard what the owl
said?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sister, I heard,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother, come to me. I am afraid,” said Natalia, and
commenced to cry a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister,” he said, “I try but I cannot. There is something
through which I cannot pass. I can see but I cannot press
through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you not climb over, dear Luis?” asked Natalia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Natalia. I have reached high as I can, but the wall
that I cannot see goes up and up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there no way to get in on the other side of the rock,
dear, dear Luis? I am very cold and afraid, being here
alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister, I have walked around. I have felt high and low.
But it is always the same. I cannot get through, I cannot
climb over, I cannot crawl under. But I shall stay here
with you, so fear not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that Natalia put her hands to her face and wept a
little, but very quietly, and it pained Luis to see the tears roll
down her cheeks and turn to little ice pearls as they fell.
After a while Natalia spoke again, but through sobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother mine, you heard what the owl said?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does it mean nothing to you?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But listen,” said Natalia. “These were the words: ‘Save
us from light and the torch’s red flame.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard that, Natalia. What does it mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means, brother, that the things in this horrible valley
fear fire. So go, brother. Leave me a while but find fire,
coming back with it swiftly. There will be sickening loneliness,
so haste, haste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that, Luis was sad, for he was in no mood to
leave his sister in that plight. Still she urged him, saying:
“Speed, brother, speed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even then he hesitated, until with a great swoop there
passed over the rock a condor wheeling low, and it said as
it passed: “Fire will conquer frosted death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You hear, brother,” said Natalia. “So speed and find
fire and return before night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Luis stayed no longer, but waved his sister a farewell
and set off down the valley, following the condor that
hovered in the air, now darting away and now returning.
So Luis knew that the great bird led him, and he ran, presently
finding the river and following it until he reached the
great vega where the waters met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the meeting of the waters he came to a house, a poor
thing made of earth and stones snuggled in a warm fold of
the hills. No one was about there, but as the condor flew
high and, circling in the air, became a small speck, Luis
knew that it would be well to stay a while and see what
might befall. Pushing open the door he saw by the ashes
in the fireplace that someone lived there, for there were red
embers well covered to keep the fire alive. So seeing that
the owner of the house would return soon he made himself
free of the place, which was the way of that country, and
brought fresh water from the spring. Then he gathered
wood and piled it neatly by the fireside. Next he blew
upon the embers and added twigs and sticks until a bright
fire glowed, after which he took the broom of twigs and
swept the earth floor clean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How the man of the house came into the room Luis never
knew, but there he was, sitting by the fire on a stool. He
looked at things but said nothing to Luis, only nodding his
head. Then he brought bread and yerba and offered some
to Luis. After they had eaten the old man spoke, and this
is what he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wicked is the white witch, and there is but one way to
defeat her. What, lad, is the manner of her defeat? Tell
me that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Luis, remembering what the condor had said, repeated
the words: “ ‘Fire will conquer frosted death.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True,” said the man slowly, nodding his head. “And
your sister is there. Now here comes our friend the condor,
who sees far and knows much.”</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Now with cold grows faint her breath,</p>
<p class='line0'>Fire will conquer frosted death.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Having said that the great bird wheeled up sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no sooner was it out of sight than a turkey came running
and stood a moment, gobbling. To it the old man
gave a lighted brand, repeating the words the condor had
spoken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Off sped the turkey with the blazing stick, running
through marsh and swamp in a straight line, and Luis and
the old man watched. Soon the bird came to a shallow
lagoon, yet made no halt. Straight through the water it
sped, and so swiftly that the spray dashed up on either side.
High the turkey held the stick, but not high enough, for the
splashing water quenched the fire, and seeing that, the bird
returned, dropping the blackened stick at the old man’s feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me another, for the maiden is quivering cold,” said
the turkey. “This time I will run round the lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. No,” answered the man. “You must know that
when the water spirit kisses the fire king, the fire king dies.
So, that you may remember, from now and for ever you
will carry on your feathers the marks of rippling water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down again swooped the condor and a little behind him
came a goose, flying heavily. As before, the condor cried:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Now with cold grows faint her breath,</p>
<p class='line0'>Fire will conquer frosted death.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>then flew away again toward the witch mountain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the goose the old man gave a blazing stick and at once
the brave bird set off, flying straight in the direction the
condor had taken. Over vega and over lagoon she went,
pausing only at a snowclad hilltop, because the stick had
burned close to her beak. So she dropped it in the snow to
get a better hold, and when she picked it up again there was
but a charred thing. Sad enough the goose returned to the
house, bearing the blackened stick, and begged to be given
another chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. No,” said the old man. “The silver snow queen’s
kiss is death to the fire king. That is something you must
remember. From now on and for ever you must carry
feathers of gray like the ashes. But here comes the condor
and we must hear his message.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sadly then the goose went away, her feathers ash gray,
and the condor wheeled low again, calling:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Fainter grows the maiden’s breath,</p>
<p class='line0'>Night must bring the frosted death,”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>and having said, like an arrow he shot off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had he gone than the long-legged, long-billed
flamingo dropped to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your beak is long,” said the old man, “but fly swiftly,
for the stick is short.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flamingo took the burning stick by the end and made
straight for the mountain, racing with all possible speed.
As for Luis, he made up his mind to tarry no longer and set
off, running like a deer. But an ostrich, seeing him, spread
her wings like sails and ran by his side. On her back Luis
placed his hand, and with that help sped as fast as the flamingo.
In the air the flamingo went like an arrow, resting
not, although the blazing fire burned her neck and breast
until it became pink and red. But that she heeded not.
Straight up the valley and to the rock where Natalia was
bound went she, and into a heap of dried moss on the south
side of the rock she dropped the blazing stick. Up leaped
the dancing flames, and with a tremendous noise the rock
flew into a thousand pieces and the power of the witch was
gone for ever. As for Natalia, she was at once freed, and
with her gentle, cool hand stroked the breast of the flamingo
so that the burns were healed, but as a sign of its bravery
the bird has carried a crimson breast from that day to this.
As for Natalia and Luis, they lived for many, many
years in the valley, and about them birds of many kinds
played and lived and reared their young, and the magic ball
of the witch lived only in the memory of men.</p>

</div>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>EL ENANO</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/E.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='E'/>VERYONE disliked El Enano who lived in the
forest, because he always lay hidden in dark places,
and when woodmen passed he jumped out on them
and beat them and took their dinners from them. He was
a squat creature, yellow of skin and snag-toothed and his
legs were crooked, his arms were crooked, and his face was
crooked. There were times when he went about on all
fours and then he looked like a great spider, for he had
scraggy whiskers that hung to the ground and looked like
legs. At other times he had the mood to make himself very
small like a little child, and then he was most horrible to
see, for his skin was wrinkled and his whiskers hung about
him like a ragged garment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet all of that the people might have forgiven and he
might have been put up with, were it not for some worse
tricks. What was most disliked was his trick of walking
softly about a house in the night-time while the people were
inside, suspecting nothing, perhaps singing and talking. Seeing
them thus, El Enano would hide in the shadows until
someone went for water to the spring, then out he would
leap, clinging fast to the hair of the boy or man and beating,
biting, scratching the while. Being released, the tortured
one would of course run to reach the house, but El Enano
would hop on one leg behind, terribly fast, and catch his victim
again just as a hand was almost laid on the door latch.
Nor could an alarm be raised, because El Enano cast a spell
of silence, so that, try as one would, neither word nor shout
would come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was his other evil trick of hiding close to the
ground and reaching out a long and elastic arm to catch boy
or girl by the ankle. But that was not worse than his habit
of making a noise like hail or rain, hearing which the people
in the house would get up to close a window, and there,
looking at them from the dark but quite close to their faces,
would be the grinning Enano holding in his hands his whiskers
that looked like a frightening curtain, his eyes red and
shining like rubies. That was very unpleasant indeed,
especially when a person was alone in the house. Nor was
it much better when he left the window, for he would hop
and skip about the house yard for hours, screaming and
howling and throwing sticks and stones. So, wherever he
was there was chill horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, a good old woman who lived alone went with
her basket to gather berries. El Enano saw her and at once
made himself into a little creature no larger than a baby
and stretched himself on a bed of bright moss between two
trees leafless and ugly. He pretended to be asleep, though
he whimpered a little as a child does when it has a bad
dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good old woman was short-sighted but her ears were
quick, and hearing the soft whimper she found the creature
and took it in her arms. To do that bent her sadly, for
Enano when small was the same weight as when his full
size.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, poor thing,” she said. “Someone has lost a baby.
Or perhaps some wild creature has carried the tender
thing from its home. So, lest it perish I will take
care of it, though to be sure, a heavier baby I never
held.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dame had no children of her own and, though poor,
was both willing and glad to share what she had with any
needy creature. Gently she took it home and having put
dry sticks on the fire she made a bed of light twigs which she
covered with a mat of feathers. Then she bustled about,
getting bread and milk for supper for the little one, feeling
happy at heart because she had rescued the unhappy creature
from the dismal forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first she was glad to see the appetite of the homeless
thing, for it soon finished the bread and milk and cried for
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless me! It must be half starved,” she said. “It may
have my supper.” So she took the food she had set out
for herself and El Enano swallowed it as quickly as he had
swallowed the first bowl. Yet still he cried for more. Off
then to the neighbours she went, borrowing milk from this
one, bread from that, rice from another, until half the children
of the village had to go on short commons that night.
The creature devoured all that was brought and still yelled
for more and the noise it made was ear-splitting. But as
it ate and felt the warmth, it grew and grew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Santa Maria!” said the dame. “What wonderful thing
is this? Already it is no longer a baby, but a grown child.
Almost it might be called ugly, but that, I suppose, is because
it was motherless and lost. It is all very sad.” Then,
because she had thought it ugly she did the more for it,
being sorry for her thoughts, though she could not help nor
hinder them. As for the creature itself, having eaten all in
the house, it gave a grunt or two, turned heavily on its side
and went to sleep, snoring terribly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning matters were worse, for El Enano was
stretched out on the floor-before the fire, his full size, and
seeing the dame he called for food, making so great a noise
that the very windows shook and his cries were heard all
over the village. So to still him, and there being nothing
to eat in the house, the good old woman went out and told
her tale to the neighbours, asking their help and advice, and
to her house they all went flocking to look at the strange
creature. One man, a stout-hearted fellow, told El Enano
that it was high time for him to be going, hearing which, the
ugly thing shrieked with wicked laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, bring me food,” it said, looking at the man with
red eyes. “Bring me food, I say, and when I have eaten
enough I may leave you. But bring me no child’s food, but
rather food for six and twenty men. Bring an armadillo
roasted and a pig and a large goose and many eggs and the
milk of twenty cows. Nor be slow about it, for I must
amuse myself while I wait and it may well be that you will
not care for the manner of my amusement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, there was small likelihood of any one there doing
that, for his amusement was in breaking things about the
house, the tables and benches, the pots and the ollas, and
when he had made sad havoc of the woman’s house he
started on the house next door, smashing doors and windows,
tearing up flowers by the roots, chasing the milk goats and
the chickens, and setting dogs to fight. Nor did he cease
in his mischief until the meal was set out for him, when he
leaped upon it and crammed it down his throat with fearful
haste, leaving neither bone nor crumb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The people of the village stood watching, whispering one
to another behind their hands, how they were shocked at all
that sight, and when at last the meal was finished, the stout-hearted
man who had spoken before stepped forward.
“Now sir!” said he to El Enano, “seeing that you have eaten
enough and more than enough, you will keep your word,
going about your business and leaving this poor woman and
us in peace. Will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. <span class='it'>No.</span> NO!” roared El Enano, each No being
louder than the one before it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you promised,” said the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What the creature said when answering that made nearly
everyone there faint with horror. It said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I promised was that I would leave when I had
eaten enough. I did not——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bold man interrupted then, saying, “Well, you have
eaten enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah yes, for one meal,” answered the cruel Enano. “But
I meant that I would leave when I have eaten enough for
always. There is to-morrow and to-morrow night. There
is the day after that and the next day and the next day.
There are to be weeks of eating and months of eating and
years of eating. You are stupid people if you think that I
shall ever have eaten enough. So I shall not leave. No.
<span class='it'>No.</span> NO!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having said that, the creature laughed in great
glee and began to throw such things as he could reach
against the walls, and so, many good things were shattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now for three days that kind of thing went on, at the end
of which time the men of the place were at their wits’ ends
to know what to do, for almost everything eatable in the
village had gone down the creature’s throat. Sad at heart,
seeing what had come to pass, the good old woman went out
and sat down to weep by the side of a quiet pool, for it
seemed to her to be a hard thing that what she had done in
kindness had ended thus, and that the house she had built
and loved and kept clean and sweet should be so sadly
wrecked and ruined. Her thoughts were broken by the
sound of a voice, and turning she saw a silver-gray fox sitting
on a rock and looking at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well enough to have a good cry,” he said, “but it is
better to be gay and have a good laugh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Good evening, Señor Zorro,” answered the dame,
drying her tears. “But who can be gay when a horrible
creature is eating everything? Who can be otherwise than
sad, seeing the trouble brought on friends?” The last she
added, being one of those who are always saddened by the
cheerlessness of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need not tell me,” said the fox. “I know everything
that has passed,” and he put his head a little sideways
like a wise young dog and seemed to smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is there to do?” asked the dame. “I am in
serious case indeed. This alocado says that he will make
no stir until he has had enough to eat for all his life, and certainly
he makes no stir to go away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trouble is that you give him enough and not too
much,” said the fox.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too much, you say? We have given him too much
already, seeing that we have given him all that we have,”
said the old dame a little angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what you must do is to give him something that he
does not like. Then he will go away,” said the fox.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easier said than done,” answered the old woman with
spirit. “Did we but give him something of which he liked
not the taste, then he would eat ten times more to take the
bad taste away. Señor Zorro, with all your cleverness, you
are but a poor adviser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that the fox thought a long while before saying
anything, then coming close to the old woman and looking
up into her face he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make your mind easy. He shall have enough to eat
this very night and all that you have to do is to see that your
neighbours do as I say, nor be full of doubt should I do
anything that seems to be contrary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the good old woman promised to warn her neighbours,
knowing well the wisdom of the fox, and together they went
to her house, where they found El Enano stretched out on
the floor, looking like a great pig, and every minute he gave
a great roar. The neighbours were both angry and afraid,
for the creature had been very destructive that day. Indeed,
he had taken delight in stripping the thatched roofs
and had desisted only when the men of the place had promised
to double the amount of his meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not five minutes had the fox and the dame been in the
house when the men of the place came in with things—with
berries and armadillos, eggs and partridges, turkeys and
bread and much fish from the lake. At once they set about
cooking, while the women commenced to brew a great bowl
of knot-grass tea. Soon the food was cooked and El Enano
fell to as greedily as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fox looked at Enano for a while, then said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a fine appetite, my friend. What will there
be for the men and the women and the children and for me
to eat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may have what I leave, and eat it when I end,” said
El Enano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us hope then that our appetites will be light,” said
the fox.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later the fox began to act horribly, jumping about
the room and whining, and calling the people lazy and inhospitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think you,” he said, “that this is the way to treat a visitor?
A pretty thing indeed to serve one and let the other
go hungry. Do I get nothing at all to eat? Quick. Bring
me potatoes and roast them, or it will be bad for all of you.
The mischief I do shall be ten times worse than any done
already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knowing that some plan was afoot the people ran out of
the house and soon came back with potatoes, and the fox
showed them how he wanted them roasted on the hearth.
So they were placed in the ashes and covered with hot coals
and when they were well done the fox told everyone to take
a potato, saying that El Enano, who was crunching the
bones of the animals he had eaten, would not like them.
But all the while the men were eating, the fox ran from one
to another whispering things, but quite loud enough for
Enano to hear. “Hush!” said he. “Say nothing. El
Enano must not know how good they are and when he asks
for some, tell him that they are all gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Yes,” said the people, keeping in with the plan.
“Do not let Enano know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time El Enano was suspicious and looked from
one man to another. “Give me all the potatoes,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are all eaten except mine,” said the fox, “but you
may taste that.” So saying he thrust the roasted potato into
the hands of Enano and the creature crammed it down its
throat at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! It is good,” he roared. “Give me more. More.
MORE.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have no more,” said the fox very loud, then, quite
softly to those who stood near him, he added, “Say nothing
about the potatoes on the hearth,” but loudly enough for El
Enano to hear, though quite well he knew that there were
none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! I heard you,” roared El Enano. “There are potatoes
on the hearth. Give them to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must let him have them,” said the fox, raking the
red-hot coals to the front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out of the way,” cried El Enano, reaching over the fox
and scooping up a double handful of hot coals, believing
them to be potatoes. Red hot as they were he swallowed
them and in another moment was rolling on the floor, howling
with pain as the fire blazed in his stomach. Up he
leaped again and dashed out of the house to fling himself by
the side of the little river. The water was cool to his face
and he drank deep, but the water in his stomach turned to
steam, so that he swelled and swelled, and presently there
was a loud explosion that shook the very hills, and El Enano
burst into a thousand pieces.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>THE HERO TWINS</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/T.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='T'/>HERE was once a woman who had two sons and
they were twins, so much alike that the mother
herself could not tell one from the other. So
Hunapu always wore a crimson feather and Balanque a
blue one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As children they spent their days in the open air, playing
in the forest, swimming in the lake, and wandering on the
plains, and so doing they came to know the animals and the
birds, finding the young ones and playing with them, so that
it was no uncommon sight to see them come home with a
panther following at their heels as a dog does. They knew
where to find the nests of birds of all kinds, fed the young
ones, and petted them, until with a call they could bring
from the trees clouds of glorious-coloured birds which would
perch on their hands and arms and shoulders. And of
course it came about in time that when animals and birds
gathered about the lads, there was no more fighting between
the wild creatures than there is between a puppy and a kitten
that have been raised together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Growing up with the wild creatures, wrestling with them
and racing with them, the boys grew strong and fleet of foot.
They could scale a cliff to reach a condor’s nest or climb a
tree as swiftly as a monkey, and in the water they were as
much at home as on the land. Down into the clear depths
they would dive, down in the cool, green lake waters, to
bring up shells and bright stones, one boy striving with the
other, laughing merrily the while. And sitting on the shore
in the sunshine they would often look across the lake to the
faraway mountain, talking about the time when they would
adventure there to see what could be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their father taught them to shoot straight with the arrow
and to use well the spear, and when they were masters of
these he made for them breastplates of silver and light helmets
that flashed in the sun. And as time went on they
wandered here and there, finding other boys of their own
age, and these, too, had helmets and breastplates of silver
made for them by their fathers and had learned the use of
the bow and spear, until at last there was a band of four
hundred of which Hunapu and Balanque were leaders.
Then there were great times with running and racing and
swimming and wrestling, and soon the Four Hundred had
agreed that when one of their number was in trouble not of
his own seeking, at the sound of the horn the rest would
come to his rescue. But not all the time was spent in play,
for the band of the Four Hundred were wise in all the arts,
playing the flute, working in metals, painting, woodcraft,
and other like activities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day Hunapu and Balanque were in the forest gathering
fruit, when there came to them an old man and wife,
weeping sadly. They were strangers to the place and, seeing
the two lads in their armour of silver, with bows in their
hands and swords by their sides and feathers of crimson and
of blue in their glittering helmets, they stood for a while
silent. But being asked, they told their tale of how they
had lived in the mountain on the other side of the lake
among a people who were in terror of their lives because of
three great and fearful giants who came now and then, taking
the cattle and the goats, destroying for mere mischief
the houses of the people, and sometimes killing the people
themselves. Nothing, they said, could withstand the
strength of the giants. Stone walls were as mere sticks to
them. They uprooted trees or turned the courses of rivers
by scooping away masses of earth with their hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that, the twin brothers were greatly disturbed,
for as they had sat by the lake sometimes, talking of the land
far away, they had heard strange noises faintly come over
the waters, which they had set down as summer thunders.
With the tale of the old man and his wife, they began to
believe that things were more serious than they had supposed.
Stepping to a place clear of trees Hunapu put his
horn to his lips and blew long and loudly, three times. Soon
from all directions came lads running, each girt with his
sword, his spear in hand and his bow at his back, breast-plate
and helmet glittering in the bright sun. You can figure
for yourself that fine band of clean, straight-limbed fellows,
each with his drawn sword and silver helmet with
drooping plume. You can imagine how they looked standing
there with the cool, green forest behind them. And
there were not only the Four Hundred, but also their
friends of the forest, here a puma, there a panther or deer,
bright-coloured birds, glorious humming-birds and proud
llamas, for not a boy but had his wild creature for a pet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the band of the Four Hundred the old man and his
wife told their tale, mentioning what they had not done
before, that their sons and daughters had been carried off
by two of the giants. At that there stepped from the ranks
a lad with flashing eyes who said that not a year should pass
over their heads before the giants were overcome, and a
great shout of joy went up. Then and there the lad who
had spoke cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let everyone step forward who will go to the land of the
evil three,” and no sooner were the words out of his lips than
the whole Four Hundred stepped forward. But, as Flashing
Eyes said, some must stay at home, for there were things
to be done, so he proposed that twenty alone should go.
Even then there was no way to decide which of them should
be of the twenty, for everyone wanted to go forward to the
adventure. At that Balanque offered to go alone to the
land, to see what would be the best plan to pursue, but again
there was trouble, for each of the Four Hundred wanted to
go with him. So at last it was decided to leave the matter
to be settled by chance. Each one was to call to his pet
wild creature, and the first two touched would go to the land
of the giants. Then a great calling went up, a naming of
names, a whistling, and a making of noises like the call of
animals, and from the leafy caves came the pets, running,
leaping, flying. Each lad there had hung his sword and
bow on a branch and stood with arms outstretched to welcome
his pet, and there was much laughter and good spirit.
Down from the sky came sweeping a hawk, straight as an
arrow, and it lit on the shoulder of Balanque. At the very
same moment a llama thrust its nose into the neck of Hunapu,
and that only a second before a fleet deer had leaped
to the side of Flashing Eyes. So all there knew that the
twin brothers were chosen to go into the land and there was
no more arguing about it. That night the band slept under
the brilliant stars and the next morning there went up a
great shout as at sunrise the brothers set off, every one of the
Four Hundred knocking his sword on his shield by way of
salute. From the top of a ridge the twins waved their band
a farewell, then they turned and a moment later were lost
to view, and the members of the band went each about his
own affairs, ready to come at a call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that day and the next they travelled, and on the morning
of the third day they came to a place where were great
black rocks, and hills all treeless and bare, and near the noon
hour they saw a great cave in the mountainside, the floor of
which was strewn with bones of animals, some of the bones
indeed being great things as big as a man, from a creature of
which the boys had never seen the like. These bones had
been cracked for the marrow in them and the teeth marks
told their tale of the size of the giant who had eaten
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To a top of the mountain the boys climbed, and when
they had gained the summit, there at their feet was a great
hollow place and at the other end sat a monstrous fellow,
his hands on his knees, his body swaying to and fro. He
was rumbling and grumbling and peering here and there in
a queer way. The boys noticed that he did not turn his
head to look with a sweep of the eyes as they did, or as you
do, turning to see in a semi-circle or over a greater extent.
His way was different. He would turn his head in a certain
direction with his eyes closed, then open them and look.
From the place where his glance lit he could not turn. If
he wanted to look somewhere else, he had to close his eyes
and begin again, so that his looking was more like shooting
a bullet at a mark than anything, and if he missed, he
missed, and had to begin again. And of course he often
missed. Yet it was his way, and he must have been very
satisfied with it to judge by the song he sang, which was
this:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“My name is Cakix,</p>
<p class='line0'>Yukub—Cakix.</p>
<p class='line0'>My eyes are bright as silver,</p>
<p class='line0'>They gleam like precious stones.</p>
<p class='line0'>My name is Cakix,</p>
<p class='line0'>Yukub—Cakix.</p>
<p class='line0'>Cakix!</p>
<p class='line0'>Cakix!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Over and over again he sang that. Then, with a tremendous
roar, he shouted:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I am Cakix,</p>
<p class='line0'>Yukub—Cakix,</p>
<p class='line0'>And all men fear me!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Then the twins, hearing that idle boast, stood on the hilltop
and shouted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Catch us, Cakix, if you can. We come to make an end
of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the giant sat still in sheer astonishment, his
eyes closed, his ear cupped in his hand to catch the direction
of the sound. The boys saw his great face turn in their direction,
and they skipped to the right and left so as to be out
of his sight, and well it was that they did so, for out over the
valley shot his arm, lengthening like elastic, and his great
fingers reached over the rock where the twins had stood, and
went feeling like five blind snakes. Finding nothing, the
hand picked up the rock, though it was as large as a house,
and back went the arm getting shorter, until the giant had
the rock under his nose. Then he shut his eyes, turned his
face down, opened his eyes again, and examined the rock.
Finding nothing he cast it away with a sudden jerk, much
as you jerk off some insect that drops on your hand unexpectedly.
Cakix sat awhile, then rose to his feet and strode
straight down the valley to where the boys had been, looking
straight ahead, of course. He went to a tree a little
way off, plucked some fruit which looked like wild cherries,
though each was as large as a pumpkin, and blundered off
without seeing the boys who crouched low and out of his
sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the giant had gone the twins ran down into the
valley and there they saw, in great caves in the hills to the
right and left, hidden heaps of flashing, precious stones—diamonds,
emeralds, rubies, opals—dazzling in the sunshine.
In other holes were heaped gold dust and silver.
While looking they were startled to hear a new roaring,
this time from the hill to which Cakix had gone. Soon the
roar formed into words and they heard:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I am Cabrakan,</p>
<p class='line0'>Cabrakan who shakes the earth,</p>
<p class='line0'>Cabrakan who shakes the sky.</p>
<p class='line0'>I am Cabrakan,</p>
<p class='line0'>Master of men.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>It was another giant, but him they did not see. Scrambling
out of the valley they reached the hilltop to see Cakix
coming back to his valley. He stopped at the tree where he
had stopped before and took some more fruit, then strode
down the hill, marking time as he walked with his:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I am Ca-kix</p>
<p class='line0'>Yu-kub—Ca-kix</p>
<p class='line0'>All men fear me.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He sat down in his old seat, his hands again on his knees,
his body swaying. He seemed uncomfortable and restless,
much as if he expected danger, getting to his feet every now
and then, peering about, going to his tree to eat fruit and
returning again to his seat. In fact, about every hour he
went to his fruit tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing that, the lads had an idea, and running to the fruit
tree, climbed into it, hiding themselves in the thick branches,
but no sooner were they safely there than they heard the
monster coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a very short while they felt the tree shake with the
giant’s heavy tread, for he was on his way to take another
meal. Then in less time than it takes to count six he was at
the tree, his great blue face hiding the scenery. Quick as
lightning, Hunapu fitted an arrow to his bow, drew the
string to his bow, and let fly. The shaft struck the ugly fellow
in the chin, but so tough was his skin that the barb only
pierced to his jaw. Still, the pain of it was enough to send
him away roaring. Back he went to his valley and threw
himself down, groaning and weeping. There was no loud
song from him now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys descended from their tree and marched down to
where Cakix lay, taking good care to keep out of the way of
his great kicking feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you?” asked the giant when he saw them.
“And what do you want here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are doctors,” they answered. “Hearing your roar
of pain, we came to help. It is your teeth that need attention.
Let us take out your bad teeth and you will be at
ease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my teeth are my strength,” said the giant. “Men
do not know it,” he added with the lack of suspicion of all
giants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True,” answered the twins. “We will pull out the old
teeth and put new ones in their place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The giant opened his mouth and to work they went with
hammers and bars of iron, and in a short time had his teeth
all out. True to their promise they put new teeth in place
of the old, but the new teeth they fitted were made of grains
of corn, and as soon as Cakix tried to eat with them he found
out his error. So in a short while he died from starvation,
and the earth was rid of one of the monsters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was great joy among the band of Four Hundred
when the hero brothers returned and told their story, for
they were glad of the good fortune of the twins and full of
rejoicing that the world had one monster the less in it. And
after a week of resting, there came a day when the whole
band, bright in their polished armour and gay with feathers
and flowers, set off for the Stone Mountain to bring back
the treasures and to slay the remaining giants. But the tale
is so long and so interesting, that it must be left for another
chapter.</p>

</div>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>THE FOUR HUNDRED</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/S.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='S'/>INGING and waving banners, the four hundred
youths with the twin brothers at their head, all of
them slim and well formed, brown of skin and
straight of limb, marched forth to the land of the giants,
their eyes bent on the far mountains all wrapped in a blue,
floating mist. No faint hearts were there, nor among them
were bullies or cowards. Not one there but could run,
leap, shoot straight, and look his friend in the eye. From
shields of silver the sunlight flashed, spearheads were like
points of hard light and each helmet was plumed. Bows
were slung across shoulders and swords were at sides, and
sandalled feet marched in step. No food they bore nor were
they otherwise burdened, for well each knew the way of the
forest and the trick of lake and stream; well each knew the
fruit-bearing trees and the bushes that were berry-hung,
and at night their roof was the star-sprinkled sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Straight as an arrow was their course to the west, to the
land of vast rocks, and gullies like axe-clefts in the earth.
Straight to the west, not turning for swift-flowing stream
nor yellow marsh; plunging through forest, climbing mountain,
scaling cliff. Straight to the west to the place where
the twin brothers had been before, until they came to the
valley of Cakix and saw his bones already white, picked by
carrion birds. There, too, they saw the caves where were
heaps of glittering diamonds, rubies like fire, emeralds cool
green like the caves of the sea. Gold, too, and silver were
there, but no heed gave they to all that, counting such things
but as toys for children, when great things had to be done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scouting far and wide to hilltop and rocky ridge, going
by twos in vast circles until they met again, they swept the
land, seeing sign of neither Cabrakan nor of the giant Zipacna,
and when the band met again all were prepared to
fare farther in their quest. None was for returning, “for,”
said they, “there is an evil thing to put out of the land and
the swifter the foul task is done the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second day of their quest they came to a great forest
and there they were set upon by great monkeys that came
in hundreds and tens of hundreds, leaping at them and snarling,
baring teeth and fiercely chattering. For a while it
looked of ill omen, but knowing that together they could
meet much the Four Hundred formed a square, so facing
north and east and south and west, a line of lads kneeling
with pointing spears, others behind them with spears over
the shoulders of those that knelt. In vain the apes dashed
at them, for not a spear was lowered nor did heart grow
faint. But the air throbbed with the cries of the hairy
things and they came in ever-increasing numbers, striving
to break by sheer weight the spear-bristling square. All
that day they came, hurling themselves against the square
until the dead things lay in masses, those that were wounded
screaming in pain and anger as they turned again to the
forest, and when the dropping sun touched the hills and the
green became black, the evil things, finding their work in
vain, gave up the fight and fled snarling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the Four Hundred all unharmed, weary, though light
of heart because of the great fellowship that was shown to
be among them, shouldered their spears, re-slung their bows
and marched on, until coming to a noisy stream they washed
themselves and their weapons. Then in the white moonlight
they slept, each with his sword at hand, while some
watched, on guard for that which might threaten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the sky was rose-tinted again they went on their
way, making for a narrow pass like a sword-slash in the
mountains, and by noon they had reached the stony cut.
High and bare were the white rocks on either side and
gloomy was the pass, nor of living thing was there sign save
a condor wheeling high. But from the rocks came strange
noises, whistlings and screamings, then of a sudden, like a
thunder clap, a mighty roar as from many voices, and the
noise of it echoed and re-echoed from rock to rock so that
the din was deafening, and when they spoke one to another,
mouth went to ear and hands were cupped. Then, when
they were well within the pass, marching over a floor so
covered with sharp-pointed rocks and great round boulders
that they had to slacken their pace, there came from above
a great rock which fell ahead of their path so as to block
the way, except for a narrow passage on either side. Looking
up, they saw, crowded on the tops of the high cliffs
on every hand, snag-toothed, evil-eyed fellows who crawled
about the rocks as though they had been lizards, so sure of
foot were they. They knew then that they were in the land
of the wild men of the mountain, the crag men, fellows
strong and stark, full of hate and viciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of a sudden, from one of the creatures who stood far up
in the cleft of a rock, one whose hair and beard were long
and white and tangled, came a hoarse cry, and lifting high
above his head a rock greater than ten armadillos he cast it
downward with great force. Ill would it have been for any
youth struck by it, but so badly and swiftly was it thrown
that it passed over the heads of all, struck the wall on the
farther side, and burst into a hundred pieces. So the youth
with the bright eyes called on his fellows to hold their
shields above their heads, edge to edge and overlapping in
such wise as to form a roof, which they did. Well it was
thus, for stones rattled down like hail, some so great that
those on whom they fell were almost borne to earth with
the sheer weight, for the men of the crags were many and
strong. Yet the weight being shared by reason of the
jointed shields, all went well, for each youth’s care was for
his fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one place the pass ran narrow, and there one of the
crag men, a fellow of great animal strength and swiftness,
suddenly leaped down and bore one of the twin brothers to
earth by the violence of his flight through the air, for the
men of the crags leaped from rock to rock like wildcats. It
was Balanque who was thus struck down, but he was on his
feet in an instant, drew his sword hastily, and as the crag
man rushed at him with jaws all foam-flecked and horrible
he passed his blade through the crag man’s chest. But the
fellow was like a wild boar, pressing on regardless of the
hurt, so that he ran up onto the hilt, caught the youth by the
waist, and flung him over his shoulder. In a moment more
he would have been on his way up the face of the cliff. As
it was, seeing what had come to pass, the crag men set up a
great yelling and screaming, thinking that victory already
lay with their man. But Bright Eyes was not idle. He fitted
an arrow to his bow and let fly, the shaft passing through
the crag man’s neck, so that he stood, as it were, spitted, and
let Balanque fall. Pierced though he was with both arrow
and sword, yet there was life in him and he fled to the rock
face and clambered up, leaving a trail of red wherever he
passed, and was seen no more by any of the band.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No pause all this while was there in the shower of stones,
but, shields well locked, the band pressed on, foot by foot,
each youth stern to win and proud of his companion, each
youth keeping the eye of hope on the thin, bright strip of
blue at the end of the pass where the mountains would fall
away. And there they came at last, toil-worn but heart-strong,
to the plain where the crag men dared not follow,
some of them almost weeping for joy because shoulder to
shoulder they had again fought their way through a great
danger and an evil place, where, had but one failed, all
might have been lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were four hundred and two happy youths that
night, though the place where they slept was bare of grass
and trees, and in the morning they were well rested and
strong, for as they had lived well and cleanly and none having
a darkened window in his breast, their sinews were as
steel, and every day was a new life in which to enter with
eyes bright and shining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had not far risen; indeed, there seemed but a
hand’s breadth between the lower edge of it and the world’s
edge, when a great wonder appeared before their eyes. It
was as if the sun were suddenly blotted out, for what they
had taken to be a low, faintly rising hill in the east had
risen up, stood for a moment like a vast cloud, then passed
swiftly to the south. At the same time there came a roar
like thunder from the cloudlike form, which came near to
deafening them. And the roar formed into words:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I am Zipacna whom men cannot slay,</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s naught that I fear save the watery way.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>That rolled rumblingly as thunderings between earth and
sky, now loud, now softer, as Zipacna strode from valley to
valley. A little later he came in sight again, but far to the
north of where they were, then vanished from their sight
into the cleft of the hills where they had battled with the
crag men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now fearful as was the sight of the giant, yet no fear was
in any heart, so, having made a meal and rested for a season,
without more to-do they set off for the place from which the
giant had arisen. It was long before they got there,
but at last they stood on the edge of a long and narrow
cañon at the end of which was a mighty pile of bones, not
alone of animals but also of men, and there were human
skulls there and shells of sea-crabs, and in and among all
these crawled venomous serpents. But most of all were
there sea-crab shells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While they gazed at this sorrowful sight, there came to
them a bent old woman, sad of face and lined and wrinkled,
and her talk was more like croaking than human speech.
Secret and watchful was she in her manner. To the twin
brothers and Bright Eyes, who stood a little apart from the
rest of the band, she spoke, asking them:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do ye here, my fine fellows? And why come ye
to this place of evil and misery?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the three answered boldly that they came to slay
the giant Zipacna, telling her that he was a thing of evil
and that evil things must be laid low if the world is to be
fair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said she, “ye are doubtless prepared to die, for
in times past many have thought to slay Zipacna, but themselves
have been led into feasting and into pleasure and soft
living, and so the memory of the good that was intended,
passed and became less than a dream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her words they found strange, but she went on to tell
them of a land over the hill where all was fair and where
none had to work and where the sun shone. There seemed
but little meaning in her words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they made answer, saying: “We have but one desire,
which is to slay Zipacna for the evil that he has done and
must do. As for your land of fine things, if to live there
would make us soft and idle, then must our eyes be closed
to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that, the old woman seemed pleased and the shadow
of a smile touched her face. But her manner changed
swiftly it seemed, for she shot a question at them which was
this: “You passed the caves of Cakix whose bones now
are white? Give me then of the precious stones that lay in
the caves there,” and so saying, stretched forth her skinny
arm, her hand hollowed to receive gifts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not for such toys that we came. We saw but
touched not the precious stones, nor the gold, nor anything
that was there. Indeed, to have done so would but have
hampered us in the doing of that which we set out to do.”
Thus Hunapu made reply and the others nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how did ye escape the apes of the forest?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We stood side by side and met danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the men of the crags, how fared ye with them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bright Eyes answered quietly: “Each covered himself
and his neighbour as well as he could and so we came out
with whole skins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A silence fell then, the three saying nothing because of
the woman’s great age, though her words and questions
seemed to lack meaning. What she said further was a
greater riddle still. “It was well done,” she told them, and
nodded slowly. “Now a greater task lies before. It is one
in which each of your band must meet danger separately
and to his peril, if eyes are not lit and feet swift. More
than that I cannot tell. But go onward until the sea is
reached and there is a lake of water. Whoso touches that
water is turned to stone, so take heed. But well indeed will
it be if Zipacna is led there. Have ye not heard him sing:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I am Zipacna whom men cannot slay.</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s naught that I fear save the watery way?</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Heard ye not that at sunrise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she said no more but turned away. Now as she
took a step her staff fell from her unsteady hands and Bright
Eyes picked it up and gave it to her. That seemed to open
her lips again, for she told them:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hearken, one and all. Many are there like swine, who
live but to eat, and Zipacna is of that sort. Watch well by
the sea shore to the end that ye see the things that may lead
to his destruction.” There was no more. She passed down
the hill and disappeared behind a thorn-bush and at the
moment that she vanished from their sight a white puma
leaped out from the other side, by which they saw that she
knew of white witcheries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The band lost no time in turning their steps seaward, and
although the day was hot and the place inviting, would not
rest in a valley through which they passed, a place rich in
fruits and soft with silk grass. That evening they came to
the sea, and at the foot of a cliff saw a great lake of water so
clear and blue that their eyes could follow, dropping from
rock ledge to rock ledge, down the slope of the side until
they saw the stones and the sand on the bottom. But there
were no swaying water-weeds, nor was there living thing.
Another thing they saw which brought the words of the
old woman to their minds, for thrown aside on the beach
were hundreds and thousands of sea-crab shells, from which
they knew that it was the sea-crab that Zipacna loved to
eat above all things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now they also saw that by some chance a great tree had
fallen, and one end of it rested in the water of the lake, and
that end had turned to stone. Another thing they saw, for
on the farther side of the lake was a bed of blue-black clay
and the colour of it was the colour of the shell of a sea-crab.
So after some thought and some talk many of the lads went
deftly to work fashioning of the clay a great sea-crab, so
great that the like was never seen. Others dragged to the lake
straight tree-trunks which they laid side by side with the
tree already there, and the end of the stick was turned to
stone as soon as it touched the water, the rest of the tree
changing more slowly. All that night they wrought, making
the great crab and setting it on the sloping tree-trunks,
so that when morning broke, that which they had set out to
do was finished, and while it was yet gray dawn they set off
for the place where Zipacna dwelt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But not all the band went. Here a lad was left, a little
way off another, then another and another, each hiding
behind rock or tussock or thorn-bush or tree. So hid, one
by one, fifty, a hundred, two hundred, until at last there
were left Balanque, Hunapu, and Bright Eyes. Then at
the foot of a hill Bright Eyes sat down and Hunapu
crouched on the shoulder of another hill that stood alone.
So, the band being all hidden, it fell out that Balanque alone
went to the place where they had met the old woman. He
fell to making a great outcry, calling on Zipacna to come
forth and rattling his sword on his shield merrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Coward!” he called. “Come forth and be slain
as was your brother Cakix, whose bones are now scattered
and white.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a voice of thunder Zipacna cried:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I am Zipacna whom men cannot slay.</p>
<p class='line0'>There’s naught that I fear but the watery way.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Over and over he chanted that, now roaring, now grumbling
as grunts a swine when it would rest. But always Balanque
taunted him, calling him a coward giant, telling him
that his days were short, and reminding him of the fate of
Cakix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the slow blood of the giant was on fire and he
rose on his elbow to look. For a time he saw nothing,
being slow of sight and moreover looking too high, little
dreaming that his noisy champion was so small. When he
saw Balanque at last, his hand shot out, but Balanque was
swift, and like the wind fled at top speed to where his
brother Hunapu lay. Down dropped Balanque and up
sprang Hunapu, clearing the ground like a deer, with Zipacna
in full chase, the giant little dreaming that he was
following a new man. But Hunapu, fresh and rested, did
as his brother had done and sped to the foot of the hill
where Bright Eyes lay. Then like an arrow went Bright
Eyes to the thorn-bush where Huno was, and Huno in his
turn darted to the tree where Chimal rested. So also
Chimal raced, and each of the band did the same when his
turn came, the giant Zipacna following, no more knowing
one lad from the other than one ant can be told from its
fellow. And in the rear those who had dropped to hide
gathered again, so that three companions became five, five
became ten, and ten became fifty, while over hill and valley
and marsh, through thorn-thicket and wooded hill, Zipacna
rushed, each lad leading him on his dance, each companion
rising from his resting-place, ready and swift. And so each
of that band met danger alone to the end that all might be
safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the merry chase led Zipacna to the cliff, and there
below him he saw what he took to be a mighty crab on the
tree-trunks, ready to drop into the water of the lake, and
at the sight of it his mouth watered and his eyes grew large.
A touch of his foot sent the crab sliding into the water, and
to save it Zipacna thrust out his hand. But he bent never
to straighten again. Solid and firm was he fixed, the crab a
crab of stone, his hand a hand of stone. Solid and firm was
he fixed, a crouching giant in a crystal lake, where he stands
to this day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the band of Four Hundred, many other valiant
deeds did they in the land, but through all, never was the
thread of their fellowship broken or tangled, and if evil
threatened one, then no rest of stay had the others until all
was well again.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>THE KILLING OF CABRAKAN</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/C.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='C'/>ABRAKAN the giant was slain by the twin brothers
and the manner of his killing was thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the death of Cakix and the turning to
stone of Zipacna, Cabrakan kept close to the stony land, but
one day venturing over the mountains where lived the crag
men, he came upon a herd of goats that had wandered out
of the way, and gathering them into a corral formed of his
legs as he sat upon the ground, he swallowed them one by
one, as a child swallows berries. The goatherd saw him
from the shelter of a tree, where he hid himself when he
first set eyes on Cabrakan. On the next day the giant came
again to the same place where he had fared so well, and
seeing a house a little way off went there and made a meal
of the cattle, leaving the man of the house in sorry case.
The third day he ventured farther, sitting down at noon by
the side of a village and picking up and eating such living
creatures as he chanced to see, much as an ant-eater picks
up ants. Nor was there aught to hinder him, for the people
fled to the woods when they heard the earth tremble under
his tread. So, soon, the tale of how Cabrakan was robbing
men came to the ears of the twin brothers, and they swore
to stay his high hand forevermore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Cabrakan knew of the manner in which Cakix had
been laid low and knew also how Zipacna had met his end,
so by neither of these ways was it possible to destroy him.
He had also pondered in his slow way, laying half-plans to
slay the twin brothers did he ever lay hands on them. Cabrakan
was the mightiest of giants and vain of his strength,
and in that vanity lay his weakness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day there came a mighty storm and a turmoil of wind
and water, of thunder and lightning, so that the trees of the
forest were laid low and the rocks uprooted, while the
thunderings of the sea-waves shook the very barancas. Black
were the heavens and clouds flew fast and low, so that Cabrakan
in his long life had seen nothing like it, and his heart
failed him. Nor did he rise all that day from the shelter
of the mountain where he had cast himself on the ground,
until the black had changed to gray and the wind was
abated. But when the clouds had passed and the sky was
again moonlit, he saw on a hilltop a little way off the twin
brothers, Hunapu and Balanque. While the storm had
raged they were sheltered in a cave, and from it they had
seen Cabrakan as he ran before the storm to seek the shelter
of the mountain. To their ears, when there were wind
lulls, came the sound of mighty whimpering and wailing
from the giant, by which they knew that his heart was far
from stout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing the twin brothers, Cabrakan rose to his feet and
asked them what they did there, and would have said more
had he not suddenly found his mind a blank. So he fell
back on his chant, though there was a quaver in his voice
because of the fear in him that had not yet died, the fear of
the storm:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I am Cabrakan,</p>
<p class='line0'>Cabrakan who shakes the earth,</p>
<p class='line0'>Cabrakan who shakes the sky,</p>
<p class='line0'>I am Cabrakan,</p>
<p class='line0'>Master of men!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>When he had made an end of his song Hunapu spoke and
said, boldly enough: “It is well, Cabrakan. Strong thou
art, but so also are we strong. Have you not seen how with
our breaths we laid low the trees of the forest? Saw ye not
how we blew and the rocks were uprooted? How, also,
the skies were darkened? But that was a small matter, for
there are things to be done, and in this upsetting of the
world my brother alone worked. Now must two of us
work, so prepare yourself well, O Cabrakan, lest a giant be
blown over the edge of the world where is neither resting-place
nor foothold. A trifling matter indeed was the storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that, a deep misgiving was in the heart of Cabrakan.
He rubbed his eyes and looked with astonishment at
the twin brothers, so slight of build, so ruddy and fair, and
seeing them and remembering the storm he could find no
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then said Balanque, as had been before agreed between
the brothers, and speaking as if in deep thought: “Perhaps
it might be better if Cabrakan joined us. It is true that he,
the earth-shaker, is after all but weak, but if he be taught to
eat of cooked flesh in the manner of men, it may be that he
too may grow strong as we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that, the giant pricked up his ears, thinking, in
the dull manner of giants, that if he did but play a little to
mislead the twin brothers he might persuade them to let him
eat of cooked meats, when, his strength becoming greater,
he might rid the earth of two who had raised so mighty and
fearful a storm. Perchance then, thought he, I shall rule
the land alone. So he said, cunningly: “Let me try my
strength against yours awhile, and if I be found weak, then
cook me the food that men eat, so that I may become strong
and thus your useful slave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that the twin brothers pretended to consult a little,
Hunapu acting as if he wished to raise another whirlwind,
Balanque as if soothing him, while Cabrakan stood watching
them, a heavy fear in his bones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let Cabrakan,” said Hunapu presently, “overturn and
pluck out the entrails of this mountain to prove himself.”
Having so said, he turned aside, but after a moment added,
as if his mind had changed on the matter: “Yet how does it
matter? We need no Cabrakan to aid us. Perhaps it were
better that I cast it over with a breath, even though Cabrakan
be blown like a leaf over the edge of the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now though the world in which the giant lived was
rocky and bare, yet it looked fair to him and he had no
mind to be cast into nothingness. So he made his face
fierce and told Hunapu that he was willing to prove his
strength. Hunapu, still playing a part, looked scornfully
at the giant as he said: “It is after all but a child’s matter,
but if the mountain be overturned, then shall the food of
men be yours and your body made strong and your wits
sharpened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cabrakan lost no more time but raised his shoulders and
put forth his arms as one about to wrestle. “Let none
meddle with me,” he said, “and before the day breaks I shall
pluck out the mountain by its roots.” So, a mountain of
flesh against the moonlit sky, he strode in five great strides
to the side of the mountain and flung his arms about it.
First he made a shift to pluck it straight from the earth, his
feet set wide apart, his muscles strained and knotted. Again
he strove to overturn it, now with shoulder fast-braced
against the sheer rock, his legs like towers. That failing,
he strove furiously, now battering like a madman, now pressing
and stamping, so that there was a trembling all about
like an earthquake. So great was his strength that the side
of the mountain broke open and a clear stream gushed forth,
the water twisting and turning along the plain like a silver
snake. All that night and morning he wrestled with the
mountain and as the day wore on he grew tired and weary,
but there was no result of his labours except the tumbling
stream and two great holes in the black living rock at the
foot of the mountain where his feet had pushed. But where
his arms had encircled, the mountain was worn smooth and
bare, the very rock was polished and shone in the sunlight.
Grunting and groaning Cabrakan toiled, until at length,
seeing that he had grown too weak for mischief, Hunapu
called on him to rest awhile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold thee a little,” he said. “This eating of the goats
and the cattle of men will make no living thing strong. A
heart thou lackest. Like an arrowless quiver or a stringless
bow art thou. In the food of men alone is strength, O
Cabrakan, so that must we eat, and the meal being done
things of worth may be seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well pleased to hear that, the weary giant cast himself
down on the ground and rubbed his palms one against another
to ease them, but as he lay there resting many a look
he gave at the motionless mountain, the glistening head
of which he had tried in vain to tear from the sky. Also
most heartily he wished that the thing was at an end, or
that the twin brothers had stayed away from that place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Balanque kindled a fire and Hunapu shot an eagle and
slowly they roasted the bird, the smell of it pleasing the
giant vastly, for he had never tasted cooked meat, nor indeed
knew any method of preparing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now in that land there grows a sort of mountain-laurel
bearing a red berry within a pod, and its power is such that
whoso eats of it will waste away as the morning mist passes
before the warming sun. Many of these berries Hunapu
took and placed in the flesh of the roasted eagle, for certain
it was that neither Balanque nor his brother could leave
that place with the giant unslain. So the roasted eagle with
the berries in it they gave to Cabrakan, who swallowed it
at a single gulp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first he felt strong as ten giants and leaped to his
feet, minded to pluck the mountain from the earth and cast
it on the twin brothers. Fiercely he gripped, so fiercely
that the top of the mountain opened and steam came forth
and a black smoke rose in the air, spreading in the form of
a vast tree; so vast it was, that it formed a cloud that veiled
the sun so that the light sickened for a time and a pale
yellow touched all things. From the top of the mountain
there gushed forth hot lava that glowed as it spread; that
came faster soon, in roaring masses. But Cabrakan rapidly
waxed weak with the poison of the berries, so weak that he
clung for support to the mountain he would have plucked
forth. And as his strength waned, the malice within him
grew, and dark were the looks, evil the eye he cast on the
twin brothers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his day was done and his course was run. Soon his
eyes grew dim and in very weariness his head fell against
the brow of the mountain. Fast and deep for a while came
his breath, his chest heaving like a sullen sea when the storm
has died. Then his strength fell away altogether and he
sank to the earth and the lava covered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So came to an end Cabrakan, the earth-shaker and master
of men, and thus did the twin brothers finish that which
they had set out to do.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>THE TALE OF THE GENTLE FOLK</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/L.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='L'/>ET me see. This story begins at the time I climbed
down the Andes on the east side and came upon a
house by a lake. There were two children living
there, one named Juan, the other, his sister, named Juanita,
and the boy was seven years old and the girl nine. They
had never seen a school, and the nearest house was more than
fifty miles away. Still they had books, knew how to read,
and I do not think that they ever found the day long. For
one thing the lake was not at all deep, and a little bit off
from the shore of it was a small island. That was a kind
of playground for them, and often they paddled their boat
to it in the early morning and stayed there all day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were other things highly interesting. On the
second day that I was there, I saw their tame ostrich, a
great gray bird that they had had for two years, and now
and then Juan would ride it, Delicia, which was the name
of the ostrich, spreading his wings like sails, and running
out in a wide zigzag circle on the pampa, caring no more
for the light weight on his back than a chicken would care
for a fly. Somehow, the birds of that place were no more
afraid of the children than the cat is afraid of you, and they
knew places where they could see the flamingo with its
scarlet cloak, the cowbird all glossy violet, the lapwings
making a drumming music, gray and white scissortail with
feathers a foot long, and red oven-birds. But their great
pet was the huanaco, tall and proud-looking, all yellow and
white, like a camel without a hump, about the size of a
donkey. They called him Campeón, and he had been on
the place as long as the children could remember. Their
father, who owned many sheep, had found him when he was
no larger than a fox, brought him to the house, and he had
become as tame as a pet lamb. Both Juan and Juanita
would roll over on him as he lay in the sun, burying their
faces in his gold-coloured fur, hugging his long neck,
wrestling with him until he got up and walked away to
find a quieter place. They would use him as a horse, harnessing
him to a little wagon, and all would go well sometimes,
but sometimes not so well, for Campeón taking it
into his head to run, the wagon would upset, the children
roll out on the soft grass, and in a moment Campeón would
free himself from the harness, going in great leaps to find
a little hill where he would perch himself on the crest and
stand like a sentinel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now one day the man who was my travelling companion
was out with his rifle, and coming upon old Campeón
standing on a high rock, took him for a strange and wild
animal, and, like many thoughtless men with a gun, followed
his impulse and shot. Campeón was badly wounded,
and doubtless astonished to receive such treatment from the
hands of a man. Anyway he limped on three legs to the
house. Juan and Juanita grieved sadly, their parents no
less, and all was done for Campeón that could be done.
As for my friend, seeing what had happened, he was the
most sorrowful of us all. For a time it seemed as though
Campeón would get better, but one day he was plainly
worse. All that day he rested on the sheltered side of the
house, refusing food and water, his finely shaped head
proudly upright, his eyes turned to the south, and the next
morning there was no sign of him. From the hill on which
he had stood we could see for miles and miles, and Juanita
and I went there, taking a telescope, and we searched the
country far and wide. In the afternoon we saddled horses
and rode many, many miles until we came to a belt of sandy
soil that ran east and west, and there we saw the trail of
our Campeón going straight south. So we turned home
sadly enough, for we knew that we would see the gentle
beast no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this is why: If you have read the “Arabian Nights,”
you will remember, in the story of Sindbad the Sailor, that
it is told that he discovered a wonderful valley in which
were the bones of hundreds and thousands of elephants.
Whether there is any truth or not in that, I do not know, but
I do know that in south Patagonia there is a vast valley
called the Valley of the Gallegos and there the huanacos go
to lay down their bones when they feel the coming of death.
And beautiful Campeón, though he had never seen that
valley, somehow felt that he must find it, being so wounded
and sick, and while we slept that moonlight night, had left
us. Both Juan and Juanita knew well enough that they
would never see Campeón dead, for they had heard the
story of the huanaco valley as often as you have the story
of Cinderella. So had I heard it, and that night when we
fell to talking about Campeón, a gaucho who looked after
the horses told us the story again, and this is what he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long, long ago, when there were giants and before there
were horses in this land, there lived a gentle people who did
not know sickness or pain or anger. They moved about
among the animals and the birds as we move about among
the flowers in the garden, and men were much kinder and
the maidens more graceful and beautiful than any on the
earth to-day. The colours of the birds were brighter and
the scent of the flowers sweeter than now; the sun was never
too hot nor the wind too cold. What was more wonderful,
the Gentle People had a strange power by means of which
they could change flowers into living things which turned
to bright-coloured birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now and then there would be great gatherings, when all
the Gentle People would come together before their prince
who sat on a throne decked with precious stones. And the
people who loved him for his wisdom as well as for his
goodness brought to him at such times gold and silver and
diamonds and rubies and glittering precious stones, and
these he would give to the young people to play with, for
in those days people loved things for their beauty alone.
The birds and animals too would join in the gathering, and
the air would be full of song and colour and the scent of
woods and flowers. On that day each person there would
have his or her wish granted, whatever it was. To be
sure, where was so much that was good, it seemed hard to
wish for anything at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one thing only that was forbidden to the Gentle
People, which was to go north until they saw no more the
stars of the Southern Cross in the sky, for after many days’
journey, they were told, there was a great dark forest on
the other side of which were fierce men who did evil. But
one day one of the Gentle People saw a strange bird, more
beautiful than anything ever seen, a bird whose breast
shone green and blue and gold, with a tail of long feathers
white as ivory. Capa it was who saw the bird, and it
seemed strange to him that seeing him the bird flew away.
Never before had he seen a bird that he could not touch and
hold, and the more the bird avoided him the more eager
was he to take it to the prince. So he followed it as it
went from place to place, always thinking that at last the
strange bird would allow him to draw near. That it feared
him he never knew, for his people knew no fear, neither did
the animals nor birds that lived among them. At last the
bird led him to the edge of the forest, and when he looked
into the sky that night he saw new stars there, at which he
wondered. Into the forest he went, always following the
bird, and so tall and thick were the trees that the sun did
not shine and the stars were blotted out at night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then one day he came to a place where he saw men with
yellow skins and teeth like a dog, who gathered about him.
Never before had he seen such people, who tore animals
apart and ate of the flesh, who tore skins from living creatures
and wore them on their own bodies. To make matters
worse, these yellow-skinned ones seized Capa and took
from him his glorious robes of gold and silver thread, tore
the feathers from his hair and plucked away the ruby that
he wore for its beauty. Then, greatly to his surprise, they
fell on one another, fighting for the things that they had
taken from Capa, so that the very robe they struggled for
was torn and trampled under foot. At that Capa turned
and fled back through the forest, never stopping day or
night, until he came to his own people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Straight to the prince he went and told his tale, hearing
which, the prince was sad at heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have,” he said, “been where there are greed and
selfishness and avarice, and it is bad for us. For those of
the yellow skin will not rest until they have found us and
brought sorrow into our midst.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he called all his people together and they came, as
they always did, singing and dancing and bearing flowers,
and after them came the birds and animals, skipping and
flying, calling. But a great silence fell upon all when they
saw their Golden Prince, for his eyes were grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he told the Gentle People all that Capa had seen, and
Capa himself stood by the side of his prince and sang a sad
song, so that the people knew of the evil on the other side
of the dark forest, and the hearts of the Gentle People were
as heavy as was the heart of the Golden Prince. And the
prince told them that if they chose, he would arm them and
lead them so that they could go forth and fight against the
yellow-faced men when they came, “but,” he went on to
say, “having learned to fight and to do hurt and to bring
death, then you yourselves will turn on each other, will
bring death to your own people. You will turn against
the animals and they will turn against you. You will walk
the land alone, and all things will avoid and hide from you.
These things of the earth, these bright and shining things
which to-day you take or leave as you wish, you will play
with no more, but will hide in boxes and under stones so
that others may not see them.” When he said this last he
picked up a handful of diamonds and rubies, of emeralds
and gold dust, and poured them from one hand to another,
so that it was as a cascade that fell bright and dazzling in
the sunlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fearing that, the Gentle Folk looked at one another, and
there was no doubt in their minds. “Far better,” said they,
“is it that we should change in some manner and flee away
than that we should do evil to the birds and beasts that are
our friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Golden Prince called on his people to follow
him, and as the yellow man broke through the forest as he
had said they would, he led all of them away swiftly, and
the multitude of animals and birds followed them. Having
arrived at a great valley where was a river, he told his people
that he would change their form so that they would
become for a time other creatures, but creatures that would
neither bite nor scratch nor spit poison, nor do any kind of
harm. So he changed them into huanacos, animals of proud
and graceful carriage, and their dress was of red and white
like the gold and silver they wore. Then when he saw his
people thus, friends of the birds and animals they loved, he
changed himself into one also, but greater and more beautiful
than any.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was a memory of that time, and even to this
day when a herd of huanacos is seen, there also is one standing
on a high rock as sentinel, keeping watch for the yellow
men. And when at last the prince huanaco died, he died
in the valley; seeing which, each of his people also laid
down their bones in that place, as you may read in many
books. So must it be until each and every huanaco has
passed away. Yet remember this: Where dies a huanaco,
there springs up a flower blue as the sky, its petals all gold-tipped.
And when the day comes in which the last huanaco
dies, then the yellow men will be gone. On that day each
flower will bend to its neighbour and, at a word, there will
stand a great host, for the spirit of the huanaco is in the flower
that is blue and gold-tipped. Then, for ever and ever, the
Gentle People will again have their land, and kindness and
gentleness and beauty and joy will be theirs once more.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>THE TALE THAT COST A DOLLAR</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/W.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='W'/>E sailed for many a day, Bob and I, up narrow
channels and down wide ones, twisting and
turning this way and that, east, west, north, south,
because of wind and tide and cape and bay, and then we
came to a kind of S-shaped strait. Through it we went and
found that it opened into a wide water, as smooth as glass
and so clear that we could see down to the sandy bottom
where seaweeds clung to rocks and fishes swam in a strange
greenish light. Then, by great good luck, we found a place
where was deep water and followed the channel landward,
and it turned out to be the cutting made by a stream of very
cold water that came down from the mountain. So there
was strange rowing for us, for we worked our boat into the
rivulet which was so narrow that very often both oars were
on the grassy land. When at last we stopped, it was because
the banks came so close together that our boat blocked
the passage, so we stepped to land as easily as one might
step onto a wharf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning, having covered our things from the foxes
and made all neat and shipshape, we set off on a walk,
climbed a high ridge and looked for a while over a confusion
of little islands and narrow straits, then wondered
at the blue of sea and sky, and after that wandered down
a long slope, to come soon to a pleasant valley, and the more
we saw of it the better we liked it. It seemed to have everything
desirable, soft grass, clear and cool water, shelter
from the winds, and peaceful quiet. A half-dozen horses
could be seen a little way off, and on a blue hill in the distance
there were cows and sheep. Soon we heard the voices
of children and the interlacing echoes. So we rounded the
hill and came upon houses, four of them altogether and
all thatched with yellow rushes. The children that we had
heard we saw, and they were playing with a pet huanaco,
and at one of the doors, seated on a rush-bottomed chair
was an old woman whose face was wrinkled and brown
though her body seemed as supple as that of a young person.
Seeing us the children left their play and stood, their dove-eyes
full of wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the rest of that day we rested, enjoying the place. In
the evening, when men and lads returned from their hunting
or their fishing or their herding or whatever they did,
there was good fellowship in the pleasant December twilight,
and as we talked and sang we became better acquainted.
Of course, like all travellers in that or any other
open country, we had to tell the tale of our wanderings,
how we came to be there and why, and when we had done,
one or the other of them told us what might be said to be
the history of their people, one helping the other out, correcting
the talker when he was at fault, and sometimes taking
the tale from him to tell it better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked Spanish, for all were originally from Chile,
and we learned that the old woman’s husband, who was no
longer living, had been a soldier who had fought against
Peru and was on board a warship called the <span class='it'>Esmeralda</span>
which was sunk by another, and on that sad day, she said,
more than a hundred were drowned. A merciful Heaven
permitted her husband to get ashore after much danger,
and wandering, he had found the valley in which we then
were (for having found it he had gone to his own place,
which I took to be Ancud or somewhere near there), and
with three neighbour families they had wandered, delighted
to find a place where were no din and clashes and war.
“And,” said the old woman, lifting her hands and throwing
them a little apart, “here by the grace of Heaven we are
at peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she had done the children chattered a little, insisting
that she had missed the most interesting part of all.
She should, they held, tell the strangers the tale of how the
valley had been made, of why there was a river, of how it
had come to pass that there were woods through which the
river flowed and especially why Laguna Viedma was salt.
The caballeros, they were sure, would like to know all
that, it being a tale most wonderful and strange. But the
old woman shook her head and made herself a cigarette,
saying that it was a tale told her by a very, very old Indian
woman who was there when she first saw the place, and the
Indian had heard it from her mother, and she from her
mother, and she again from her mother, so the tale went so
far back that whether it had truth in it or not none could
tell. At that the young people said that, true or not, it was
a good tale, and they were so politely insistent, especially a
little girl who petted a blue-eyed kitten, that we heard the
story which, so far as I know, has never yet been written,
and were it not written now might be forgotten for ever.
So here it is, and my daughters, Julia and Helen, like it
better than any story in this book, though their brothers
are in favour of the tale of the Noseless People.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Long ago, said the old woman, south of the Laguna
Viedma lived a bruja, or kind of witch, a mean and wicked
creature who had a house at the foot of the cordilleras built
of great slabs of stone, in which there were three rooms.
In one of these rooms she had imprisoned a boy and in another
a girl, and the boy she allowed to roam about in the
garden in the daytime but locked him up whenever the sun
set, and the girl she locked up whenever the sun rose, so
that the boy had never known night and the girl had never
seen day, nor had the boy or the girl cast eyes on one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy, growing out of childhood, grew restless, and
one day he dug a passage in his stone cell under the wall
and up on the other side, much as a rabbit might have done,
so that after being locked up he could spend a little time
in the twilight, watching the dancing green stars that were
fireflies. Still, whenever it grew dark and the edges of
the things that he saw were no longer sharp, he scuttled
back to his stone room, not knowing what clawed horror
might unfold from the dark. For we must remember, said
the old woman who told the tale, in all his life he had seen
no human being but the witch, and knew no more of the
moving world than the horses that we use know of the
horses that drag a thousand noisy wheels in the city streets.
Nor did he know of the ten thousand silver lights in the sky
at night, nor of the bright glory of the Southern Cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening when the boy was in the vega, he having
crawled through his passage, his heart fell when he saw a
strange creature dressed in white, with long black hair and
soft eyes. When the strange thing walked towards him he
was startled, for he also saw the gray mist from which she
came, and in that mist he seemed to see other thickening
shapes. So, for a moment, he had a mind to kill the long-haired
creature as an evil thing, and picked up a sharp
stone, but his heart somehow bade him do otherwise, and
he turned and fled, running straight to his hole by the
side of the bush, then dropped to his knees without a backward
look, scrambled to his cell and put a big flat stone over
the hole, lest the long-haired one should follow and kill
him. As for the girl, seeing the swift-running lad, she
watched in surprise for a little, then followed, and coming
to the hole in the ground shuddered with fear, believing
that under the earth she trod lived thousands of such creatures
that, perchance, roamed in the daytime and did evil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day when the witch let the lad out after shutting
the girl in her stone place, she was surprised to see fear in
his eyes, for all that night he had lain awake in his dread of
the long-haired one, trembling at every sound, lest the unknown
should find the passage and creep through into his
cell of safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that day he worked hard, rolling a great boulder up
from the valley so that he might close the outer opening of
his burrow, but so heavy was the rock and so far the
distance, that the sun set before he had rolled it to its
place. Still, he moved it a long way and got it over his
burrow and close to the bush. Then he sought the witch
so that she might lock him up for the night, but to his grief
she did not come, and this is why:</p>

<p class='pindent'>After she had unlocked the girl’s door that evening she
remembered the look of fear that had been in the lad’s eyes,
so went into his cell to see if anything harmful was there,
and her foot struck the flat stone. Then she found the opening
of the hole. Wondering greatly, she crawled into the
passage, pushing hard because it was too small for her.
At one place she had to remove much dirt above her head
because the roof was so low, and pulling away a stone, down
came a shower of little stones and of earth, then more and
still more, until with a thundering noise the big boulder,
which the lad had rolled and left, fell into the hole and very
narrowly escaped the witch. So she was stuck fast, deep
buried in the ground, her onward way blocked by the
boulder against which she butted her head in vain. As
for getting back by the way she had come, that was impossible,
for, finding night coming on and no guardian
witch, the boy fled to his cell. There he saw the black, uncovered
hole and the flat rock he had placed over it, and
listening he heard sounds in the tunnel. In his fear of the
long-haired creature he pulled the flat rock over the hole
again and on it piled rock upon rock. That done he gave
a sigh of relief and straightened himself, but his heart sank
when he saw in his cell the very thing that he most dreaded.
For the girl, being brave in the dark and glad in the silence,
sought a companion in her loneliness, and found the boy’s
cell with its open door. But with the lad night brought
fear. In the golden sunshine he met danger gladly enough,
but in the soft moonlight when the true forms of things were
lost, the world seemed baseless and dreamlike and unsubstantial.
So, seeing the creature of the night in his cell,
he threw up his arms and, not daring to look, fled into the
garden and into the ghostly world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whispering stillness of what he saw made him tremble
violently, for it was a dead world and not the world throbbing
with the sweet song of friendly birds and the noise of
busy insects. The green and gold of day had strangely gone
and the brave hardness that he knew in his world was not
in the sky, but instead, a soft black roof hung with strange
lights. And even his feet were robbed of speed, and trees
and bushes clawed him. As he fled he looked over his
shoulder in affright because of the long-haired pursuer.
Not far did he go before a creeping vine caught him about
the ankle and his foot struck a root, so that he fell headlong,
striking his head against a tree-trunk. The silver-sprinkled
sky whirled wildly and then all went black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He woke to the touch of delicate light hands bathing his
face with cool water, but lay with fast-closed eyes, believing,
hoping that it was a dream. Presently, though still
faint and weary and in pain, he opened his eyes to see the
face of the maiden as she bent over him, and the cloud of
soft hair that rippled as silk grass ripples when touched by
the breeze. As he looked, finding something gentle and
kind in the face, he chanced to see the white moon, great
and cold, rushing swiftly through an army of silver clouds.
The sight was new and terrible and he grew dizzy and faint.
Something evil seemed to have stolen the warmth from the
sky so that the birds had died and the flowers withered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With eyelids closed he wrestled with his fear and heard
the golden voice of the girl saying again and again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I not your friend in this lonely place? Am I not
your friend? Why then do you run from me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of his fear he was wrapped in happiness at the
words, for he knew that he had been long lonely, though
he had not told himself so until then. Yet the darkness
stretching wide and the stars and the shadows made him
chill at heart, though like a true man he strove to master
his fear. While he kept his eyes closed it was well enough,
but to open them on the sunless world was pain. For all
that, he nerved himself to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Let us go,” he said, “from this world of shadows,”
and she, thinking that he meant the place of the witch, took
his hand and said, “Yes. Let us go, my new-found friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose to his feet then and said that he was ready, though
he covered his eyes with his hand. Then she told him to
wait, saying she knew of a hollow place in a tree in which
was a flint the old witch had hidden, and the armadillo had
told her there was some magic in it, though what that magic
power was he did not know, except that it had the power to
cut down trees. It would be well, she added, for them to
take it with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great was his loneliness while she was away, and though
he opened his eyes once, all things were so strange and cold
and silent that he closed them again. Once he heard the
shrieking voice of the witch-woman under the ground and
he wondered why the sound was so muffled. Had she, too,
come near to death in the black world? Again he heard
the voice of the owl, melancholy and solemn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his new-found friend came soon, to his joy, and she
gave him the flint and took his hand to lead him, for he
dared not open his eyes because of the moon, and she thought
him sightless. So all that night they ran thus, hand in
hand, over places where there were cruel sharp stones, across
mist-blown swamps and pantano lands, and where the way
was hard he carried the maiden, though he always kept his
eyes closed and trusted to her guidance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the girl was strong and helpful to him until the dark
began to pass, then, with the rose of dawn the lad cried
joyfully, “I fear no more now and am strong again. Perhaps
it is the magic of the flint that makes me so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she said, “Alas! I fear that the stone we carry is not
good but evil. Let us throw it away, for I grow weak and
afraid and ill at ease. Greatly I fear the sky so hard and
blue, my new-found friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that, he laughed a little and called her his
Golden One and bade her trust in him, so she was comforted
a little, though still afraid. Then, as the rose and gold of
sunrise sped across the sky and the thousand birds awoke
and burst into song, his heart was full of happiness, but
she, having heard no such noise before, wept with the utter
pain of it, clapping her hands over her ears. Her eyes, too,
were full of burning pain because of the growing flood of
light. Still, she fought with her fear for a while, though
she was sadly longing for the world with its friendly dark.
But when the sun came up in his brilliancy and the boy
greeted it with a great shout of joy, she was as one stunned
and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! Go, dear lad, and leave me to die all parched and
withered. For into the burning light I cannot go. My
eyes are scorched and my brain is on fire. The sweet silence
is no more and the heart of night is dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that sad speech the lad was full of grief lest he
should lose his new-found friend, so he pulled from the
trees light-green branches and wove them into a canopy
and bound about her brow a veil of cool greenness, then
lifting her in his arms, he went on happy in the singing sunshine,
yet sad because she was white-faced and full of
strange tremblings. At noon, when the heat of day was
like brass and the sky was fierce with light, they came to a
place of tender green coolness where was a vine-hung
hollow in the mountainside, and there they rested awhile.
The lad made for the maid a seat of matted leaves and
mosses and brought to her berries and fruits and tender
roots, and for drink, cool water in a leaf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So at last came the light between day and night when
neither was afraid, she brave at heart because of the passing
of the burning light of day and he fearless because the
night of sorrow had not yet come. Hand in hand they went
towards a great plain all flower-spangled and smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The witch they had forgotten, or thinking of her had
supposed her to be fast in her own place. Yet it was not
so, for deep in the burrow in which she had vainly tried to
go back and as vainly tried to go forward she had her mind
made up to escape by some means. With a mighty heave,
for she was of great strength, she burst her way out of the
ground and then stood, shaking the dirt out of her eyes and
her ears and her hair. That done she sought the boy and
the girl, but found no trace of them. At last the armadillo
who always tells secrets, told her of what had happened,
so she sought the magic flint, the terrible cutting flint which
she could throw to kill. Finding it, too, gone, she was in
mad rage, whirling, leaping, and screaming. Another moment
and she left the place, going in mighty leaps, her bow
and arrow in her hand, and soon from the top of a hill she
saw the boy and girl as they stood looking at the smiling
valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that valley was the valley of the huanacos wherein
the witch was powerless, and that she well knew. Did the
two once gain the shelter of the mountains, all her witcheries
would be of no avail. Indeed, that very thing the sentinel
huanaco was telling the children at the very moment
the witch caught sight of them, and the animal bade them
haste lest the witch touch them before they crossed the
plain. So hand in hand boy and girl ran, and seeing them
so near safety the witch went over the ground like a horse,
bounding over bush and stone, taking five yards at each
stride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then to help the children, from right and from left came
huanacos, by tens and twenties and hundreds, their proud
heads held high, their soft eyes full of loving kindness, and
they ran by the side of the two who fled, and some formed
in a body behind them so that the arrows shot by the witch
could not touch boy or girl, though many a good huanaco
laid down his life, thus shielding them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing the pass to which things had come, the old witch
bethought her of another plan, and taking her magic arrow
she shot it high in the air so that it passed over the herd of
huanacos and fell to earth far in front of the boy and girl.
As soon as the shaft touched the ground it split into a
thousand pieces, each no thicker than spider silk, and
each fragment took root and became a tree. In a single
moment the whole plain was covered with a thick, solemn
tangle of forest through which no living creature could
hope to pass, and sadly enough, boy and girl turned to
behold the witch coming toward them fast. But all about
her feet were the animal friends of the boy and girl, foxes
and small creatures, while about her head flew many tinamou-partridges,
so that soon she was forced to slacken her
pace. Then to boy and girl came a puma, smooth and
beautiful, and it said, “El pedernal! El pedernal!” and
they at once remembered the magic flint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking the stone and poising it the lad threw with all
his might. Through the air it hummed, and hearing the
music of it the old witch gave a piercing yell, for well she
knew its power. Straight toward the forest the stone flew,
and before it trees fell to right and left as though the stone
had been a great and keen axe handled by a giant, and the
path it made was straight and open and clear, so that
through the gap they saw the valley. Again the huanacos
closed about the boy and girl so that nothing might harm
them, and down through the straight opening they all went.
Nor was that all. Having cut a way through the forest
tangle the flint dropped and buried itself into the ground,
boring down and down, until it fell into the lake of clear
water that lies hidden under the ground. Out of the hole
came bubbling a stream of water, silver and cool, and it
flowed down the gap in the forest and passed out on the
farther side, then split to run on both sides of the witch, to
whom water was death. Deeper and deeper became the
water until it covered the very colina on which she stood,
and when at last the water touched her feet, she melted as
sugar does.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The stream,” said the old woman who told us the tale,
“went on and on and became Laguna Viedma, and the
forest is the forest you see. As for the boy and the girl,
they became man and wife and lived in the place where we
now sit for many, many years, and about them stayed many
huanacos and deer and tinamou, and the sorry past was
soon forgotten like a last year’s nest.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having said all that, the old woman, whose face was
wrinkled and brown, drew a white woollen poncho over her
shoulders and eyed me. After a while she said that she had
told that tale to four men at different times and each of them
had liked it so well that he had given her a dollar of silver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” said she with spirit, “I can show you the dollars
to prove that what I say is true.” So getting up she went
into the house and soon came out again with four silver
coins, carrying them in her open palm. For a little while
she was silent and so was I, and the men sitting around pretended
to be inattentive and lit cigarettes and blew smoke
rings, jangling their big spurs now and then. Presently
the old woman said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some day a brave caballero will hear the tale and he
will make the four dollars to be five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thinking it well to be counted brave, and hoping that I
was a gentleman, I brought her expectations to pass, having
a dollar with me, as luck had it. And certainly I think that
the tale was worth a dollar, and if it was not, then it was
worth many dollars to rest a while in that quiet place and
to meet such worthy and simple folk.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>THE MAGIC KNOT</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/T.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='T'/>HERE was once a lad whose name was Borac who
might have been the son of a king, and again might
not. No one ever really knew, though a wise old
woman who lived near by said that he was, and so many
things that she said were found to be true that people believed
what she said of Borac. Borac was found by the
side of a lake by a man who was gathering fruit. This
man saw what he took to be a shining white stone, and,
going to it, found a basket neatly made of silk grass lined
with soft white feathers, and in it, warm and cosy like a
bird in a nest, was the child Borac. So the man took the
basket and the baby home with him, and his children were
delighted with their new playmate. That made four children
for the man and his wife to take care of, for he had
three of his own, but good luck came to him from the day
he found Borac and things went very well. As for the newcomer,
he was treated exactly as were the rest of the children
in that house, and like them grew strong of limb and
ruddy of face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So there were two boys and two girls, playmates, and
each day was a golden one for them. Somehow, Borac
seemed to see things and to know things that the others
often missed. Not that his sight was any better than the
sight of his foster-brother and&nbsp;-sisters, for in the place
where they lived at the foot of the mountains, where the
air was clean and sharp, everyone had good eyesight.
Things at a distance were as clear-cut as things are when
you look through a field-glass. But as Borac grew, he saw
beauty in common things and pointed out to the others
the colours in the sunset sky, the pure blue of the lake
water, the sun-sparkle on the stream, and the fresh green
of the hill grass. Then, too, there were the songs of the
birds. That music they had grown up with, had heard so
often that they had forgotten the beauty of it all, until one
day Borac began to call like a bird and from every tree
and bush came a chorus so rich and so wonderful that the
joy in their hearts was more like a sweet pain. You know
how that is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now there was a place in the mountains where the cliff
ran straight up, and so smooth it was that no one had ever
climbed it, though the children there were sure-footed as
goats and could climb the highest places without growing
faint or dizzy when high up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half-way up this cliff was a broad ledge on which a condor
had built its nest, and Borac and his friends often
played at the foot of the cliff and loved to watch the condor
drop off of his rock shelf with spread wings and float
far above, winding in mighty circles for hours, floating
higher and higher into the sky without wing motion and
just leaning over, it seemed, to go with the wind or against
the wind, up and up, until he looked no larger than a
humming-bird against the blue. So high he went sometimes
that if one but blinked for a moment, the little black
spot seemed to disappear. If any one of them had been
granted a wish, that wish would have been that he or she
might have the power to soar and wheel like the great bird,
sweeping up in a great curve to hang in the air, floating
downward in a long, long line, sliding, as it were, to sweep
up again at will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day when Borac and his three friends were there,
one of the girls called out in great trouble, pointing up the
face of the cliff to a place where was a cranny, and looking,
the others saw a large mottled owl with two staring eyes
perched on a point of rock, and just below they could make
out a pigeon on its nest. It seemed to them that the owl was
screaming, “Ah! I see you, little dove. Sharp as needles
are my claws. Sharp, too, is my beak to tear you, and little
owls are hungry for the flesh of doves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That seemed very terrible to those who saw, and the four
children began to shout and to throw stones, trying to chase
the owl away, but it was of no use. The nest of the rock-pigeon
was too far away and the face of the rock too smooth
and sheer for any of them to climb, so there seemed nothing
for it but to watch until the little bird was captured. The
pigeon, they saw, was in great fear, but in spite of the
danger stayed on the nest. As for the owl, he turned his
face downwards toward them, hearing the noise, and they
saw his cruel eyes and his head-feathers that were like horns,
but he gave no sign of going away. Indeed, he hooted at
them, as if to say, “Who cares for you, little earth-creatures?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the watchers it was like a jailor hanging over a
prisoner who is innocent, or like a man with a sword about
to deal a death-blow to a child. It was very sad to them to
see the dove all helpless and, above her, the owl ready to
dash down at any moment. As for Borac, he was so full
of grief that he had started to climb the cliff, though it was
clear to him as well as to his friends that he could not
mount far. When he had climbed some little way up, a
wonderful thing came to pass. From the sky where the
condor wheeled, came dropping a long feather, a wing-feather
which the great bird had plucked, and it fell spinning
and at last rested on a little rock hump close to Borac’s
right hand. His left hand, meanwhile, was clutching fast
to the rock above his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now why Borac should pick up such a thing as a feather
when he needed his hands free he did not know, and certainly
none of his friends could guess. But he did so, and
not only that but looked at it curiously, just as you would
do, to note the smooth lines of it and the beauty of the
thing. And as he did this he twisted it just a little, gave it
a turn with his fingers. At that he floated gently from the
face of the rock, out from the cliff and into the air, until
he was poised over the heads of his companions, hanging as
lightly as a piece of thistle-down. Again he twisted it,
just a little, and went upward. Then he tried other things,
pointing it a little toward the face of the cliff, and, wonderful
enough, floated that way. So he as well as the children
knew that there was magic in the feather. Up then he
darted with its aid, swiftly as the swiftest bird, rushing
through the air, then swooped away from the cliff most
beautifully, went upward again, made a great circle as he
dived again, then shot upward, and so to the place where
the owl sat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing him, the sharp-clawed thing raised its wings and
softly flew away and was seen no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somehow, the three at the foot of the cliff were not at all
afraid. They knew everything would come right. Indeed,
they leaped with joy and delight when they saw
Borac standing on the rock ledge, and they clapped their
hands when they heard the little slate-coloured creature
coo with gratitude when the owl vanished. But what Borac
did next they could not tell, though they saw him stoop and
pick up something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is what happened: Borac, up there, saw behind the
dove’s nest a coil of silky stuff no thicker than a fine thread,
and in the middle of it was a queer knot. At first he
thought it was a part of the nest, so would not touch it, but
soon the bird rose from its nest, picked up the end of the
thread, and walked with it to Borac. He took it then,
wound in the rest of the coil, and it lay in his hand taking
up no more room than a wild cherry would, so very fine it
was in texture. But he knew at once that he had the magic
knot of which the old woman had so often spoken, the magic
knot that could bind evil things, though they were so strong
that they could lift rocks. How the magic knot got there
neither he nor any one else could know, and it did not matter
very much. Certainly but for it, the owl would have
captured the dove. The condor may have known about
it, for condors are very wise, travel far, and see much that
escapes the eyes of men. Anyway, Borac did not stay long,
but feather in hand leaped into the air, though he was so
high that his friends looked to him no larger than foxes, and
swooping down landed lightly on the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there were experiments. Each of the children
wanted to try the feather in turn and great fun they had
that evening, flying higher and higher as they grew braver,
until at last each of them had stood on the faraway shelf
where was the condor’s nest. It was easy to do and they
found that all would go well so long as there was neither
doubt nor fear. The magic feather would carry them quite
safely so long as they believed in it. If they did not believe
in it, then not a foot could they get from the earth.
As for the magic thread with its wonderful knot, what good
that might be they did not know, but it was certainly magic,
and magic things, as they knew, always come in useful. So
they guarded it carefully, packing it away in a nutshell
where it should be handy when needed. And the magic
knot came in useful much sooner than they expected, and if
you are not going to be scared you may hear the tale, but
if the hearing of it will make you nervous in the dark, or
cause you to be afraid so that at night, being outside the
house and nearing it, you make a hurried run to get to the
door, then you had better read no farther. For you may
as well understand that the magic knot did actually do the
work and the thing that it bound is bound for ever and ever,
so that no one of you should be afraid of the dark, nor be
shivery as your hand is set on the door latch lest something
should leap out of the dark and seize you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here then is the place to stop if you are timid, but if you
are not you may read what comes next and after these three
stars:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>One night in the village next to that in which Borac and
his three friends lived, something happened. In a little
house that sat near a clearing some people were sitting talking,
and being thirsty one of them asked the boy of the
house to take the gourd and go to the stream for water. He
did so, going bravely into the dark, for the stream was but
a hundred steps away from the house door. The people in
the house waited and waited, wondering why the boy was
so long, and at last someone went to look for him. Down
to the little river they went and back again, but there was
no sign of the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that was bad enough, but what was worse was that
on the next night a boy went to visit a friend who lived five
houses away, and that boy never reached his friend’s house.
His father and mother went to look for him and traced his
footsteps in the sandy road, but came to a place where the
steps stopped and beyond was smooth sand. Then on the
third night something happened. A girl and her sister
were visiting and the younger girl started to go home alone.
No sooner had she left than her sister, remembering how
the boys had vanished, ran after her to bear her company.
The night was moonless and a thin cold mist hid the stars,
but the sister could see the little one’s white dress a little
way ahead. She could not see very plainly because it was
so dark, but there was no mistake about it. The fluttering
white thing was in front, cloudy looking certainly, but there.
Then of a sudden something happened. The white cloud
that was a dress had vanished. So the older sister ran to
the place and heard a voice calling and the sound seemed
to come from above her head. She looked up and saw a
flutter of white for an instant, then nothing more. Her
sister had vanished exactly as a bubble vanishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Because of all that there was terror in the village. In
the day the people were nervous enough, but at night there
was great fear. No one dared stir out after sunset. Even
within doors people sat as if on thorns. Then one night
when there was no glimmer of light in the sky, a family sitting
in a house heard a great tearing sound as if some giant
hand was pulling at the thatched roof. The light in the
house went out and those who sat in the room crouched
trembling, crowding close to one another, their hearts throbbing.
When at last it was quiet again they saw that a
ragged hole was in the roof, and on the earth floor there
was a mark like the claw of a great bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was all, but there was trouble in the hearts of the
people, and soon the news of it all came to Borac. He
listened to the tale attentively and so did the wise old
woman who was there. She nodded thoughtfully and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But have no fear. Things will not go ill while the moon
shines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said much more, particularly asking Borac if he had
the magic knot, and then she told him what to do. And
with the growing moon the trouble ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, Borac was busy. The old woman had talked
with him as has been said, and day after day with the help
of his magic feather he made great flights, circling high in
the sky, crossing valleys, and passing over mountain and
lake, and seeing strange lands far to the west and the great
ocean that reached far until it touched the sky. Then the
condors were good to him and with them he flew hither
and thither, as fast and as high as they, never tiring, never
lagging, and they took him in a new direction and to a place
where out of a great bare valley rose a monstrous black
bird, a bird so strong that it could bear away a llama in
each claw and another in its beak. So big it was that beside
it a condor seemed tiny. It was an ugly bird and
the eye of it was heavy-lidded and baleful, its claws sharp.
The wings flapped so heavily that the wind from them
caused the trees near by to bend their tops as if they leaned
to whisper, one to another. Borac at once knew it for the
great bird of evil that swooped down on dark nights and
carried men away, and he also knew that in the world
there was but one and that it laid but one egg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For many days the lad watched, following the bird
wherever it went, and at last discovered its foul nest high
up in the mountains where man never set foot. By the
side of its nest, in which was an egg so great that a goat
might have hidden in the shell of it, was a hole in the
rock. In this hole, the sides of which were very steep, were
all those whom the great bird had carried away. Day by
day, as Borac saw, the bird dropped fruit down into the
hole, so that the unhappy creatures might live until the
egg was hatched, when they would, he knew, be taken out
and given to the young one to eat. When the great bird
had flown away, Borac ventured close to the hole and called
out to the people there to be of good cheer, for he would
rescue them soon and also kill the bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back to his own place he flew then with his magic
feather and told everyone what he had seen, and, as the wise
old woman advised, Borac and his friends chose a stout
tree and cut the top and the branches from it. They then
formed the trunk into the shape of a youth, leaving the
roots fast in the earth. This figure they painted and
covered with a garment and in the hand of it they put a
large gourd, so that from afar the thing looked like one
going for water. Close to it they built a house of poles and
covered it with grass for a roof, in the fashion of the
country, and all that they had ready before the moon was
again dark. Then everything being prepared, Borac went
into the house and waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three nights he was there, then taking his feather flew
here and there. At last he saw a great black cloud swiftly
moving, which he knew to be the evil bird, so he made for
his house and soon there came a great tearing sound in the
air. As the bird came it set up a terrific screeching and
the noise that it made with the beating of its wings was like
thunder-claps. Down it swooped on the man of wood,
claws outstretched and beak open, and in another moment
it had seized the figure and was trying to lift it. The
more the figure resisted, the tighter the evil bird held, its
claws and beak fast sunk in the wood. So fearful were its
struggles that the earth about the root of the tree heaved,
and it seemed as if the roots would be torn out bodily.
Then finding that it could not move the thing, the bird
made to fly away, but its talons and beak were held by the
wood as if in a vise. All its flappings and tearings then
were of no avail, and try as it would, it could not release
itself. Faster and harder it beat its wings and the wind
from them bowed the bushes and shook the house in which
Borac was hidden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Borac came forth with magic feather and magic
knot, and was soon in the air above the struggling bird.
Hovering there he unloosed the thread with the magic knot
and lowered it. Down it dropped and was soon entangled
in the beating wings like a web about a fly, and, slight
though the thread was, against the power of the magic knot
nothing could prevail. So in a short time the great black
bird was bound for ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning Borac flew to the nest in the far valley
and went down into the pit in which were the unlucky ones
that the bird had caught. One by one he carried them
from that place and to their homes. As for the egg, putting
his shoulder against it he tumbled it from the ledge where
the nest was, and it fell and was smashed to pieces. So
there was an end of the evil bird, which soon died; and it
was the last of its kind; and to-day, of all the birds of the
air, there are none to do harm to man.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>THE BAD WISHERS</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/F.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='F'/>OR days and days and for weeks and weeks Canassa
and I rode to the south, and the only break in our
days was when we changed our tired horses for fresh
ones. That we did sometimes four times in the day. We
had plenty of choice, for we were driving some three hundred
mares and colts. Canassa was a gaucho, a plainsman,
as we would say, and a most excellent horseman, so he made
nothing at all of catching an unbroken colt with his lasso
and saddling and riding it, doing his share of the driving
with the horse new to saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With so much of it I grew tired, and one night as we
sat about our little campfire heating water for our maté, the
tea we made from herbs, I said that I wished the job was
at an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canassa strummed his guitar awhile, then laid it aside
and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wishes are no good and he who wishes, risks. For why?
Whenever you wish, you leave out something that should
not be left out, and so things go wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told him that a small wish might be all right, but this
he would not allow. Things had to go just so, he said, and
no one in the world was wise enough to wish things as they
should be wished. Then, in the way of the men of the
pampas, he told me a tale to prove the truth of what he
said, and this was the tale:</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Once there was a woman in Paraguay who had no children
and she wished day and night for a boy and a girl.
She did more than wish, going to a place in the woods
where were wild sweet limes and oranges and lemons, and
where the pools were covered with great leaves of waterliles,
and in the quiet of that place she made a song about
the children she wished for. In that song she sang of the
boy as handsome and swift of foot and strong of arm, and
she sang of the girl as a light creature with keen eyes and
silken hair. Day after day she did this and at last her
wish came true, for she had a boy and a girl and the boy
was straight-limbed and well made and the girl as lovely
as a flower of the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far, so good. But that was not the end. The woman
had wished that the boy might be strong and brave and
swift and all these he was. But she had not thought of other
things, and, sad to say, he lacked sight. For him there was
neither day nor night, neither sun nor moon, neither green
of the pampas nor blue of the sky. As for the girl, it is
true that she had sight so keen that she could see the eye of
a humming-bird at a hundred paces, but her legs were
withered and useless and she could not walk, for the mother
in wishing had said nothing of her health and strength. To
crawl about, helping herself with her hands, was as much as
she could do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing what had come to pass the mother was very sad,
for her dream had become a very pesadilla, a nightmare.
So she grieved and each day grew paler, and at last one
evening caught her children in her arms and kissed them
and they saw her no more, the neighbours next morning
telling them that she had died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now one day when the children were well grown, there
came to the house in which they lived a man in a torn
poncho who said that he had walked hundreds of miles,
from the land of the Noseless People where it is always
cold. He was tired and hungry and torn with thorn-bushes,
and his feet were cut with stones. So the boy and girl
took him into the house and gave him water to wash himself
with and chipa bread made of mandioca flour and
sweet raspadura in banana leaves. When he was well
rested and refreshed, in return for their great kindness he
told them of a strange old witch-woman who lived far
away, one who knew many secrets by means of which she
could do wonderful things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a turn of the hand,” said he, “she could make the
girl strong of limb and with another turn could restore sight
to the lad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he went on to tell of other witches that he knew,
saying that there were many who were not all bad, but
like men, were a mixture. True, they sometimes kept children,
but that was not to be laid to their meanness but
rather to their love of beauty. “For,” he said, “it is
no more wrong to keep a child to look at than it is
to pluck a flower or to cage a bird. Or, to put it another
way, it is as wrong to cage a bird as it is to steal a
child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meal being done the three of them sang a little, and
the sun being set the old man bade them good-night and
stretched out under a tree to sleep, and the next morning
before the children awoke he had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that day brother and sister talked much of what the
old man had told them, and the girl’s face flushed red and
her eyes were bright as she looked at her brother and
thought of how sweet it would be if he could see the mists
of the morning and the cool cleanness of the night. Meanwhile
he in his dark world wondered how he could find
his way to the witch and persuade her to work her magic,
so that his sister might be able to go up and down, and to
skip and dance on limbs that were alive. So at last they
fell to talking, and the end of it all was that they started
on a journey to the witch, the brother carrying the sister
on his shoulder while she guided him safely through thorn-thicket,
past swamps where alligators lay hidden, and
through valleys where bushy palmetto grew shoulder high.
Each night they found some cool place where was a spring
of crystal, or a pool of dark sweet water, and at last they
came to the little hills where the witch lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found that all was as the old man had said, for the
witch was a lonely creature who saw few, because few
passed that way. She was glad enough to see her visitors
and led them to a fragrant leafy place, and seeing that the
girl was drooping like a wind-wearied bird, did what things
she could. To the boy she told tales of the birds and the
golden light of the sun and the green of spreading branches,
thinking that with her tales they would be comforted and
content to stay with her in her soft green valley. But the
more she did for their comfort and the more she told them
of the wonders of the world, the greater was their desire to
be whole, the girl with her limbs unbound, the boy with his
eyes unsealed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before long the lad told the witch of the old man’s visit
and of their hopes that had led them to take the great
journey, and then the old woman’s heart fell as she saw her
dream of companionship vanish. She knew that as soon
as they were whole again they would leave her as the birds
that she fed and tended in nesting time left her when winter
came. Then she told them no more pleasant tales, but tales
of things dead and cold, of gray skies and desert places, of
tangled forests where evil things lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is better not to see at all,” she said, “than to see foul
things and heart-searing things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the boy spoke up and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There being such things, the more I would have my
eyesight, so that I might clear those tangled forests of the
evil beasts of which you speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that, the witch sighed, though her heart was
glad at the boy’s words. So she turned to the girl, telling
her of the harm that sometimes came to those who walked,
of the creatures that do violence and scratch and maul; of
stocks and stones that hurt and cut tender feet; of venomous
things that hide under rocks. But the girl heard patiently,
then clasped her hands and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that is all the more reason that I ask what I
ask, for with feet light and active I can skip away
from the hurtful things, if indeed my brother does not kill
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the witch, “perhaps when you know the
beauty of the place in which I live, you will be content to
stay with me. I must do what you ask because you are what
you are by reason of a wish that went wrong. Now to get
the magic leaves with which to cure you I must take a
journey of a day and a night, and it is part of the magic
that those who would be cured must do a task. So to-morrow
while I am away you must work, and if I find the
task finished you shall be cured. But if you should not finish
the task, then all will remain as it is; but I will be eyes for
the boy, telling him of the fine things of the world, and for
the girl I will be as limbs, running for her, working for her.
But I shall do and not wish. Truth is that I would gladly
see both of you whole again, but then you would go away,
and I sorely lack companionship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a little the witch said to the girl:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, little one, if this place were yours what would
you do to make it better to live in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would,” answered the girl, “have all the thorn-bushes
taken away that are now in the little forest behind the house,
so that Brother could walk about without being scratched
and torn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is fair enough,” said the witch. “And you, boy,
what would your wish be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would have all the little stones that are in the valley
taken away, so that Sister could play on the soft grass without
being hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the witch, “it is in the magic that you set
your own tasks. So the boy must have every stone cleared
away before I return and the girl must see to it that there
are no more thorn-bushes. Hard are the things that you
have wished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the witch had gone there was no joy in the hearts
of the children, for it seemed impossible that a blind boy
should gather the stones and no more possible for a lame
girl to clear the forest. There was a little time in which
they tried, but they had to give up. So they stood wondering,
and for a moment thought of starting for their own
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, strange to tell, who should come over the hill
but the old man in the torn poncho, and they were both very
glad to see him. After he had rested awhile they told him
their troubles and spoke of their grief because, in spite of
all their efforts, it seemed as though all must come to
naught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish——” began the boy, but the old man stopped
him with lifted finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wishing never does,” he said. “But help does much
and many can help one.” He put his fingers to his mouth
and gave a peculiar whistle, and at once the sky was darkened
with birds and each bird dropped to the ground, picked
up a stone and flew away with it, so that the valley was
cleared in a moment. He gave another whistle and from
everywhere came rabbits which ran into the woods, skipping
and leaping, and at once set to work to gnaw the stems
of the bushes. And as soon as the bushes fell, foxes came
and dragged them away, so that in an hour the forest was
clear, and when the witch came back, behold, the set task
was done!</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the witch took the leaves that she had brought and
made a brew of them, giving the liquid to brother and
sister to drink. “But,” said she, “see to it that you speak
no word, for if you do before sunset, then back you go to
your old state.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both promised that heartily and drank. But as soon as
the boy saw the green of the grass, and the blue and crimson
and purple flowers, and the humming-birds like living
diamonds in the shade, he called out in his great joy:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Sister, see how beautiful!” and at once he was in
utter darkness again. At the same moment, feeling her
limbs strong, the girl was filled with such delight that she
tossed her arms into the air and danced. Then from her
came a keen cry of pain as she heard her brother’s cry and
knew that he was blind again. There was a moment when
she wanted to lose all that she had gained so that she could
tell her brother that she shared his grief, but she remembered
that being strong she could help him in his pain,
so she went to him and took him by the hand and kissed his
cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At sunset the boy, who had been sitting quiet, spoke, turning
his sightless face to the witch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have tried to be good to us,” he said, “and you
have been as kind as it lay in your power to be. Since
Sister is well, I am content. And I have seen the beauty of
the world, though it was in a flash. So, mother witch, since
you have not been able to give us all we ask, we will give
you all that we have. Come, then, to the place where we
live and see the things that we love, the birds and the
flowers and the trees, and we will try in kindness to repay
you for what you have done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that, the witch suddenly burst into singing and
hand-clapping and told them that the spell was broken because
she had been befriended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No witch am I,” she said, “but your own mother who
did not die, but was changed to this form for vain wishes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the boy regained his sight and the mother became
as she had been, tall and straight and beautiful and kind,
and the three of them went to their old home and lived there
for many years, very happy and contented.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>THE HUNGRY OLD WITCH</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/S.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='S'/>HE was a witch, she was very old, and she was
always hungry, and she lived long ago near a forest
where now is Uruguay, and just in the corner where
Brazil and Argentina touch. They were the days when
mighty beasts moved in the marshes and when strange creatures
with wings like bats flew in the air. There were also
great worms then, so strong that they bored through mountains
and rocks as an ordinary worm makes its way through
clay. The size and the strength of the old witch may be
guessed when you know that she once caught one of the
giant worms and killed it for the sake of the stone in its
head. And there is this about the stone—it is green in
colour and shaped like an arrow-head a little blunted, and
precious for those who know the secret, because he who has
one may fly through the air between sunrise and sunset, but
never in the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old witch had another secret thing. It was a powder,
and the knowledge of how to make it was hers alone and is
now lost. All that is known of it is that it was made
from the dried bodies of tree-frogs mixed with goat’s milk.
With it she could, by sprinkling a little of it where wanted,
make things grow wonderfully. She could also turn plants
to animals with it, or change vines into serpents, thorn-bushes
into foxes, little leaves into ants. Living creatures
she also changed, turning cats into jaguars, lizards into alligators,
and bats into horrible flying things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This old witch had lived for hundreds of years, so long
indeed that the memory of men did not know a time when
she was not, and fathers and grandfathers and great grandfathers
all had the same tale to tell of how she had always
devoured cattle and pigs and goats, making no account at
all of carrying off in one night all the animals of a village.
To be sure, some had tried to fight her by shooting arrows,
but it was of no use, for by her magic the shafts were bent
into a shape like a letter V as soon as they touched her. So
in time it came about that men would put outside the village
in a corral one half of what they had raised in a year, letting
the old witch take it, hoping that thus she would leave
them in peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last there grew up a lad, a sober fellow of courage,
who said little and thought much, and he refused to take
animals to the corral when the time came for the old witch
to visit that place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the people asked him his reason for refusing, he
said that he had had a dream in which he saw himself as a
bird in a cage, but when he had been there a little while a
sweet climbing vine had grown up about the cage and on
this vine was a white flower which twisted its way in between
the bars. Then, as he looked at it, the flower changed
to a smiling maiden who held a golden key in her hand.
This key she had given to him and with it he had opened
the door of the cage. So, he went on to say, both he and the
maiden had gone away. What the end of the dream was he
did not know, for at that point he had wakened with the
sound of singing and music in his ears, from which he
judged that all turned out well, though he had not seen the
end of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Because of this dream and what it might betoken he said
that he would not put anything in the corral for the old
witch, but instead would venture forth and seek her out,
to the end that the land might be free from her witcheries
and evil work. Nor could any persuade him to the contrary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not right,” he said, “that we should give away for
nothing that which we have grown and tended and learned
to love, nor is it right that we should feed and fatten the evil
thing that destroys us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the wise men of that place named the lad by a word
which means Stout Heart, and because he was loved by all,
many trembled and turned pale when the morning came on
which he took his lance and alone went off into the forest,
ready for whatever might befall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For three days Stout Heart walked, and at last came to
a place all grassy and flowery, where he sat down by the
side of a lake under a tree. He was tired, for he had
walked far that day and found that slumber began to overtake
him. That was well enough, for he was used to sleep
under the bare heavens, but with his slumber came confused
dreams of harmful things which he seemed to see coming
out of the ground, so he climbed into the tree, where he
found a resting-place among the branches and was soon
asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he slept there came to the side of the lake the old
witch, who cast her basket net into the water and began to
fish, and as she fished she sang in a croaking and harsh voice
this:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Things in the air,</p>
<p class='line0'>Things in the water—</p>
<p class='line0'>Nothing is fair,</p>
<p class='line0'>So come to the slaughter.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>They were not the words, but that is what the words
meant. But unpleasant as was the song, yet it worked a
kind of charm, and things came to her, so that her basket net
was filled again and again. The fish she cast into a
kind of wicker cage, of which she had several.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the croaking song chased sleep from the eyes of
Stout Heart, and looking down he saw the wrinkled crone
and the great pile of fish that she had cast on the bank, and
his heart was grieved for two things—one that there was
such waste of good life, the other that he had left his spear
hidden in the grass. He grieved too, a little, because he
knew that on account of his long walk he was weak from
hunger and thirst. So there seemed little that could be
done and he sat very still, trusting that until he was better
prepared for action the old witch would not see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all his stillness was of no avail. Looking at the
shadow of the tree as it lay upon the surface of the water,
she saw the lad’s shadow. Then she looked up and saw
him. Had she had her magic green stone with her, things
would have been far different and this tale all the shorter.
But not having it and being quite unable to climb trees, she
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are faint and hungry. Come down, come down,
good lad, for I have much here that is good to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that, Stout Heart laughed, knowing that she
was not to be trusted, and he told her that he was very well
indeed where he was. So she tried another trick, spreading
on the grass fruits and berries, and saying in a wheedling
voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, son, eat with me. I do not like to eat alone.
Here are fresh fruits and here is honey. Come down that
I may talk with you and treat you as a son, for I am very
lonesome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Stout Heart still laughed at her, although, to be
sure, he was a lad of great appetite and his hungriness increased
in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any other trap to set for me?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that, the witch fell into a black and terrible rage,
dancing about and gnashing her teeth, frothing at the mouth
and hooking her long nails at him like a cat, and the sight
of her was very horrible, but the lad kept his heart up and
was well content with his place in the tree, the more as he
saw her great strength. For in her rage she plucked a great
rock the size of a man’s body from the earth where it was
sunk deep, and cast it at the tree with such force that the
tree shook from root to tip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the old witch stood with knit brows, then
she went on her hands and knees and fell to gathering up
blades of grass until she had a little heap. All the time
she was cursing and groaning, grumbling and snarling like
a cat. When she had gathered enough grass she stood up
and began to sprinkle a grayish powder over the grass heap,
and as she did this she talked mumblingly, saying:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Creep and crawl—creep and crawl!</p>
<p class='line0'>Up the tree-trunk, on the branch.</p>
<p class='line0'>Creep and crawl—creep and crawl!</p>
<p class='line0'>Over leaf and over twig.</p>
<p class='line0'>Seek and find the living thing.</p>
<p class='line0'>Pinch him, bite him, torture him.</p>
<p class='line0'>Creep and crawl—creep and crawl!</p>
<p class='line0'>Make him drop like rotting fruit.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>So she went on, moving about in a little circle and sprinkling
the powder over the grass. Presently the pile of grass
began to move as if it hid some living thing, and soon the
grass blades became smaller, rounded themselves, and
turned brown. Then from them shot out fine hair-like
points which became legs, and so each separate leaf turned
to an ant. To the tree they scurried and up the trunk
they swarmed, a little army marching over every leaf and
twig until the green became brown, and louder and louder
the old witch screamed, waving her arms the while:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Creep and crawl—creep and crawl!</p>
<p class='line0'>Up the tree-trunk, on the branch.</p>
<p class='line0'>Creep and crawl—creep and crawl!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The nearer to Stout Heart that they came, the louder she
shrieked, leaping about and waving her long-taloned hands
as she ordered:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Seek and find the living thing.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Then Stout Heart knew that trouble was brewing indeed,
for against so many enemies there was no fighting. For a
time he avoided them, but for a time only, and that by going
higher and higher in the tree, crawling along the branch
that hung over the lake, but nearer and nearer the ants
came, and louder she bade them to</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Pinch him, bite him, torture him.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>At last there was nothing for it but to drop out of the
tree, for he had been hanging to the end of a branch and
the ants were already swarming over his hands and some
running down his arms. So he let go his hold and went
into the lake with a splash, down out of the sunshine and
into the cool green-blue of the waters. He swam a little,
trying to get out of the way before coming up, but had to
put his head out soon to get a breath. Then suddenly he
seemed to be in the middle of something that was moving
about strangely, and it was with a sudden leaping of the
heart that he found himself in the old witch’s basket net being
drawn ashore. To be sure, he struggled and tried to
escape, but it was of no use. What with her magic and her
strength he was no more in her hands than is a little fish in
the hands of a man. He was all mixed up with other lake
things, with fish and with scum, with water-beetles and
sticky weed, with mud and with wriggling creatures, and
presently he found himself toppled head foremost into a
basket, all dazed and weak. It was dark there, but by the
bumping he knew that he was being carried somewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon he was tumbled into an evil-smelling place and must
have fallen into a trance, or slept. Again, he may not have
known what passed because of the old witch’s enchantments,
for when he came to himself he did not know whether he
had been there for a long time or a little. But soon he
made out that he was in a stone house and through a small
hole in the wall saw that the place where the house stood
was bare of grass and full of great gray rocks, and he remembered
his dream and thought that it was all very unlike
what had really happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in that he was not altogether right, for while he was
in no cage and no twining vine with glorious flower was
there, yet there was something else. For after a little while
a door opened, and he saw standing in a light that nearly
blinded him with its brightness a maiden full of winning
grace, and light and slender, who stretched out her hand to
him and led him out of the dark into a great hall of stone
with a vast fireplace. Then having heard his story, which
brought tears to her blue eyes, she opened a lattice and
showed him a little room where he might hide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For,” said she, “I also was brought to this place long
ago, and when I came the old witch killed one who was her
slave before me. But before she died she told me the story
of the green stone which the witch has, and also how were
used the magic powders. Since then I have been here alone
and have been her slave. But now she will kill me and
will keep you for her servant until she tires of you, when
she will catch another. And so it has been for many, many
years, and each one that dies has told the power of the green
stone to the other, though none had dared to use it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now hearing all that, Stout Heart was all for running
away at once and taking the maiden from that dreadful
place, but just as he opened his mouth to speak there came
to their ears the voice of the old witch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hide then,” said the maiden, “and all may yet go well.
For I must go to get the green stone by means of which we
may fly. With you I will dare. Alone I was afraid to
venture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even then he hesitated and did not wish to hide, but she
thrust him into a little room and closed the door. Through
the wall he heard the witch enter and throw a pile of wood
on the hearth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a new prize,” said the ogress. “You I have fattened
long enough and now you must be my meal. One
slave at a time is enough for me, and the lad will do. Go
then, fetch pepper and salt, red pepper and black, and see
to it that you lose no time, for I am hungry and cannot
wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl went into another room and the witch fell on her
knees and began to build a roaring fire. Soon the maiden
reëntered, but running lightly, and as she passed the old
woman she cast on her some of the magic powder which she
had brought instead of salt and pepper. The hag had no
idea that it was the powder that the girl had thrown, and
thinking that she had been careless with the salt and pepper
began to scold her, then getting to her feet took her by the
hair, opened the door of the little room in which Stout
Heart was, and little knowing that the lad was there cast
her in, screaming:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay there, useless one, until I am ready to roast you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maiden thrust the green stone into the hands of
Stout Heart and at once they flew through the window and
out under the arch of the sky. As for the old witch, the
powder did its work and she began to swell so that she
could not pass out of any of the doors. But presently the
boy and girl, from a height at which they could see below
them the narrow valley and the witch house, saw that the
old hag was struggling to get out by way of the roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two lost no time then. They flew swift and high.
But swift too was the witch. Her growing had finished
and out over the top of the house she burst, and seeing the
escaping pair, began to run in the direction they had taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So there was much speeding both in the air and on the
earth, and unlucky it was for the two that the green stone
allowed those who carried it to fly only in the daytime. All
this the maiden told Stout Heart as they flew. The old
witch well remembered that at night there was no power
in the flying stone and was gleeful in her wicked old heart
as she watched the sun and the lengthening shadows. So
she kept on with giant strides and leapings, and going at
such a rate that she was always very nigh under the two in
the air. No deer, no huanaco could have bounded lighter
over the ground than she did, and no ostrich could have
moved swifter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the sun began to drop in the western sky, and
he and she were looking at one another with concern as
they flew, the maiden bethought her of a plan, and scattering
some of the magic powder on the earth she rejoiced to
see that the leaves on which the powder fell turned into
rabbits. The sight of that the witch could not resist, and
she stopped a moment to catch some of the little animals
and swallow them, so a little time was won for the fliers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the hungry old witch soon went on and regained
the time she had lost and was under them again, running as
fast as ever. So more powder was scattered, this time on
some thorn-bushes, which changed to foxes. Again the
old woman stopped to eat and the two gained a little. But
the sun was lower and they found themselves dropping ever
nearer to the earth, flying indeed but little higher than the
tree-tops, and as they saw, the old witch in her leaps lacked
but little of touching them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ahead of them was the lake in which Stout Heart had
been caught, the waters red as blood with the light of the
western sky, but the power of the stone was failing with the
waning day, and of the powder they had but a small handful
left. As for the witch, so near was she that they could
hear her breathing, could almost imagine that they felt her
terrible claws in their garments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the bank of the lake the last handful of the magic
powder was cast, and they saw the grass turn to ants and the
stones to great turtles as they passed over the water, but so
low that their feet almost touched the surface of the lake.
The power of the stone was growing weak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old witch, seeing the turtles, stopped to swallow
them, shells and heads, and that gave the youth and maiden
time enough to reach the opposite shore, where the power
of the stone was quite exhausted as the sun touched the rim
of the earth. The gentle maiden clung to Stout Heart in
great fear then as they saw the old witch plunge into the
lake, for she could travel on water as fast as she could on
land. Indeed, the fearful old woman cut through the
waters so swiftly that a great wave leaped up on either side
of her, and it was clear that before the sun had gone she
would have her claws in the two friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when she was in the middle of the lake the weight of
the turtles she had swallowed began to bear her down. In
vain she struggled, making a great uproar and lashing her
hands and feet so furiously that the water became hot and
a great steam rose up. Her force was spent and the turtles
were like great stones within her, so she sank beneath the
water, and was seen no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great was the joy of the people when Stout Heart
brought the maiden to his home, for she became his wife
and was loved by all there as the fairest woman among them.</p>

</div>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>THE WONDERFUL MIRROR</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/T.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='T'/>HIS is the tale of Suso who was the daughter of a
very rich man, a very kind-hearted one, too. Never
was beggar turned from his door, nor in the length
and breadth of his land was there hunger or want. And he
loved Suso no less than she loved him. She was very close
to his heart and all that could be done to make her happy he
did. As for her, there was no pleasure in her day if she was
not assured of his happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When her sister had left home to be married, Suso and
her father had gone about planning a great park which
Suso was to have for her own, a park of terraced, flowered
hills. And when it was finished, both birds and animals
came to live there and the air was full of song. So in that
place Suso played with her companions, and their hearts
were in tune with the beauty all about. It was a never-ending
pleasure to seek out new places in the great park,
cool nooks in which were little waterfalls whose silver
music mingled with the whispering of the leaves, or shaded
spots where were ponds of crystal water and fountains and
seats and bright green carpets of moss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a long time there was happiness, until, indeed,
her father married again, for her mother had died when
Suso was a small child. Then one day there was a cloud of
grief in the maiden’s heart, because on a silent, moonlit
night she had walked with her father and he had told her
that he was troubled with a wasting sickness and feared that
he had not long to live. Some enemy, he said, had cast a
spell on him, so that day by day he grew weaker and weaker
and weaker. Wise men and doctors had looked into the
matter, had sat solemnly and thought, had guessed and wondered,
but had agreed on one thing only—that something
was wrong. What that something was they did not know,
but they agreed that if the thing that was wrong could be
discovered and removed, all would go well again. Because
of what her father had told her, Suso was sad and often
wandered to a quiet place where she could tell her troubles
to the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stepmother was not at all fair in her ways and not
only disliked Suso, but was very mean and treacherous, hiding
her hatred from the father and petting Suso when he
was near, stroking her hair and saying pretty things. So
well did the wicked woman play her part that nothing could
have made the father believe other than that she loved
Suso quite as much as he did. For instance, on that moonlit
night when he had told his daughter of his trouble, seeing
her tears, for she had wept bitterly, he had said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Suso, my dove, your mother will care for you
tenderly when I am dead, for she loves you dearly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that the girl stifled her sobs and dried her tears, lest
the father she loved so well should be wounded by her grief,
and seeing her calmed he had supposed that all was well
and that his words had soothed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But see how it really was with Suso and her stepmother.
There was one day, not long after, when father and stepmother
and daughter were standing by the fountain, watching
the wavering shadows flying across the green, when the
man suddenly felt a clutching pain at his heart and was
forced to sit down for very weakness. When he felt a
little better and the first sharpness of the pain had gone,
Suso walked with him to the house, and when he was comfortably
seated and had a feather robe cast about him, he
bade her return to her stepmother. That she did, because
she was bid, although her wish would have been to sit at
his feet. Because of her unwillingness and her grief she
went softly, and not singing and dancing, as was her fashion.
And what was her terror when she saw and heard the
wicked woman talking to a great horned owl that sat in
the hollow of an old tree! So terrible that seemed, that
Suso could find nothing to say, but stood with clasped hands,
her heart a-flutter. Seeing Suso, the woman motioned to
the owl and the bird said no more, but sat listening, its head
on one side. Then the stepmother took Suso by the hand
and drew her into a place where they could be seen by the
father, but far enough away to be out of earshot. But the
father, seeing the woman and the maiden standing thus together,
was happy, thinking that his daughter had a friend.
It made him happier still to see the woman take Suso’s
arm and pull it gently about her waist. But he did not
hear what was said, for had he heard, it would have cut him
to the heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is what the woman said, and her voice was like a
poison-dart as she whispered loud enough for the owl to
hear:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suso, stand thus with your arm about my waist so that
your father may see us together. Thus he will think that I
love you.” Then she hissed in the girl’s ear: “But I hate
you, hate you, hate you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the owl lifted his head, blew a little and repeated
softly: “Hate you—Hoo!—Hoo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From far off in the woods came the sound of an answering
owl like an echo: “Hate you—Hoo!—Hoo!” and it seemed
to Suso that all the world hated her for no cause, for the
screeching parrots, too, repeated the cry. As for the sweet
feathered things that she loved, they had all fled from that
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the stepmother spoke again and the owl dropped
to a lower branch the better to hear. “Suso,” said the
woman, “your father cannot live much longer. The spell
is upon him and day by day he nears his death. Because
of that I am glad, for when he dies, all this land, the house,
and all its riches, must be mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that vicious speech Suso was well nigh faint
with fear and horror and would have sped to her father to
warn him. But the woman caught her by the wrist, twisting
it painfully, and pinched the soft place on her arm with
her other hand, and stooping again so that it seemed to the
watching father that she kissed Suso, she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But see to it that you say no word, for the moment that
you say anything but good of me, that moment your father
will fall dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So what was Suso to do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it was that Suso crept to quiet places and told her
tale to the whispering leaves and to the evening breeze,
and thus it was that in the midst of all that beauty of golden
sunlight and silver-glinted waters and flower-twined forest
she could not but be sad. For there were tears in her heart,
and everything that her father did for her was as nothing
and like a crumbling tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had told the trees (and trees bend their tops
though they are foot-fast, and leaves, too, whisper one to
another), so that the tale went abroad, though of this, Suso
knew nothing.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Now while all this was going on there lived in the hills
far off a youth, and his name was Huathia. Brown-haired
he was and bright-eyed too, with clear skin and strong arms,
and all who knew him said that he was a good lad and
honest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a herder of goats and llamas, and one day, as he
was out in the vega with his flock, he chanced to see a falcon
wheeling high in the air, carrying something in its beak that
sent the rays of the sun flashing far, like silver light. Then
the bird dipped with the thing it was carrying, looking like
a glittering falling star, and Huathia for a moment lost
sight of the bird as it dropped behind a bush. But it soon
rose and took to flight, this time without the shining thing.
So Huathia went to the place where the falcon had dropped,
and there at the bottom of a little stream he saw a bright
round piece of silver. The lad rescued it and looked at it
with astonishment as it lay in his hand, a polished and
smooth disc it was, that reflected his face as clearly as a
mirror. So he kept it, wrapping it in a leaf, and took it
that night to the place where the lad lived with another
herdsman, a very wise and good man who knew many
strange things, and he told the youth that it was the wonderful
mirror of one called Paracaca, long since dead. He said
that whoever looked in it saw his own face as others saw it,
but the owner of the mirror saw something else, “for,”
added he, “with it you may see the hidden spirit of other
people, seeing through the mask they wear. And if a man
has the face of a man but the heart of a fox then certainly
while such a man beholds his own face, you shall see the
other creature in him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that, the youth Huathia was much amazed at the
magic of the thing and, holding it so that the face of his
herder friend was shown in the mirror, saw, not the rough
bearded face of the man alone, all knotted like a tree-trunk,
but a face that was full of kindness and gentleness, at which
he was glad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he placed the wonderful mirror in his bag and carried
it about with him. The next day, while he was leaning
against the trunk of a tree and playing on his flute, he
seemed to hear a whispering, and putting his reed away he
listened intently. Still and small, still and small were the
voices that he heard, as tree-head bent to tree-head and leaf
murmured to leaf, but soon he caught the rumour that ran,
and learned the tale that in the country of the rich man there
was a creature timorous and frail, whose gentle heart
was heavy with sorrow, and that an unknown evil brooded
dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No time lost he then, seeing that there was something of
worth that he could possibly do, but gave the care of the
goats and llamas to his friend, took his arrows and bow, his
bag with a little food and the wonderful mirror, and after
bidding his friend good-bye set off for the land of the rich
man. What was strange was that while all had been silent
in the soft green woods that morning, except for the sound
of his flute, no sooner had he started on his way than a gay
chorus came from the bright birds and the world was full
of mirth. So, well content, he went on his way, a ragged
herdsman, but light of heart and strong of limb and brave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into the land of the rich man he went and came in time
to a place where sat the maiden under a tree, doves at her
feet and glittering humming-birds about her head. When
Suso saw the youth her heart leaped for joy, for she knew
him for a kind lad, though never before had she set eyes on
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you a beggar and poor?” she asked. “For here
there is plenty for all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am no beggar,” he answered, “and for myself I am
well content with what I have. But it has been whispered
about the world and I have heard the tale, that there is a
great sorrow upon you, and that some unknown evil is destroying
the beauty and the bliss of this place, so I have
come to do what is to be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that Suso said no more but rose up and took Huathia
by the hand and led him to her father. It was a day on
which the good man was very weak, but seeing that his
daughter was pleased with her new companion he ordered
his servants to spread a table under the trees, and the three
of them had a feast of goat’s milk and fruit, and cassava
bread, though the father could eat but little. Then Huathia
took his flute and played sweet music until the world seemed
full of peace, and gripping grief had vanished. Suso, too,
sang sweetly, so that for a moment the father thought that
the shadow that was upon him was but a dream and might
pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked long and long, the three of them, and
Huathia learned much about the rich man’s failing strength,
whereupon it came to him somehow, that by means of his
wonderful mirror he might perchance discover what evil
thing was about that place. To him the rich man said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If with this mirror you can find the hidden evil thing
and can restore my strength again, then there is nothing too
great that I own which may not be yours for the asking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is but one thing I want,” said Huathia. “For I
love Suso the gentle and would marry her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rich man thought long after this speech, stroking the
hair of Suso who sat at his knee, for it had not entered into
his mind that his daughter might be the gift which the
youth demanded as his price. But looking at the maiden
he saw that her eyes were cast down, though for a moment
they had looked up swiftly as Huathia spoke. Then, too,
it was certain that since the youth had been there, the song
of the birds was louder in the thicket and the green of the
trees brighter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the father said thoughtfully: “If you find the cause of
the trouble that is upon me and relieve it so that I am healed
again, then you may have my daughter for your wife,
though you must promise me that you will stay in this
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, Huathia promised readily enough, and stooped to
Suso and kissed her, and having done so, went away to the
dark pool in the woods to sleep, at the very moment the
stepmother came out of the house to join her husband and
his daughter.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class='pindent'>As it happened that night, there was a thin new moon,
and the youth slept but little because of the croaking noise
made by the frogs. Presently, full awake, he sat up, and
it seemed to him that the air was full of noise, not only of
frogs but of the hooting of owls and the whirring of bats,
and looking he saw the strange sight of a great white toad
with two heads, and presently about that fearful thing other
things gathered. From rock and hole came unclean creatures,
abominable serpents and centipedes and great gray
spiders, and all these gathered in a circle, the two-headed
toad in the centre. With wide-open eyes Huathia watched,
although the sight of so much that was noisome came near
to benumbing and stupefying him, and incomplete shapes
seemed to be looking at him with evil eyes from the black
depth of the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the owl began to mourn and the song fell into words
and the youth heard this:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Who knows where hides our queen? Hoo! Hoo!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>And first one creature and then another answered:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“The toad, our queen, lies hid unsought</p>
<p class='line0'>Beneath the stone that men have wrought.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>And so it went on, a mad and horrible concert, with bat
and owl and great ghost-moth whirling about on silent
wings, until sickened of it all Huathia rose up and clapping
his hands to his ears fled from the place. And when he
had gained a quiet and lonely spot he sat down, but in his
ears rang what he had heard:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“The toad, our queen, lies hid unsought</p>
<p class='line0'>Beneath the stone that men have wrought.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>So he wondered and wondered where could be the stone
that men had wrought, and the story that men had told of
a great temple on the mountains came to him. But that
place seemed too far away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When it was full day the youth went to the house, and in
time the rich man came forth and greeted him. Then came
the stepmother, who fixed her large dark eyes on Huathia,
not looking at him straight, but sideways. Suso came
shortly afterward and the youth could not take his eyes
from her. It seemed to him that she was the most beautiful
of living things as she sat on her stool by the side of her
father, her hair touched by the golden light so that it seemed
to be as full of ripples as a sun-kissed brook. So there was
pleasant talk while they ate, and, after, a drinking-in of soft
music as Huathia played on his flute. Suso sang when
Huathia had finished, and though her song had a touch of
sadness in it, it seemed to her pleased father that all on
earth that was soft and shapely and fair was gathered there
in that garden, until catching the eye of his wife he was reminded
that his life was flowing away, and the old grief
came upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somehow talk fell upon Huathia and his mirror and the
strange way in which he had found it, and he took it from
his bag. As he looked in it, Suso came and stood behind
him, so that he saw the reflection of her face and the true
picture of herself, and there was a gentleness there, the
gentleness of the dove and the purity of the flower. The
rich man came, too, looking over Huathia’s shoulder and
saw his own reflection. But what the youth saw was a face
that denoted great bravery and kindness. Seeing all this
the stepmother stretched her hand across the table and took
the mirror, gazing at the picture of her own dark beauty.
Then Huathia stepped to her side and looked into the disc.
He saw, not the dark eyes and night-black hair that she
saw, not the face of a proud woman, but the face of a toad,
and when she held the polished silver further off, the better
to see, the toad-face changed, so that he saw a double-headed
toad. But of that she knew nothing and did not even guess
that he knew her for a vile witch and no true woman. And
as she continued to gaze and her thoughts wandered, so did
new things come into the picture that Huathia saw, and he
beheld about her neck two writhing white snakes, a sight so
horrible that he could scarcely hold his countenance or prevent
himself from calling out. Having seen to her content,
the woman rose from her stool and left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rich man, already tired, for his night’s sleep did not
revive him, stood up and beckoned to the youth to give him
an arm. Suso supported him on the other side and so they
walked slowly to a seat beneath a great flowering bush near
the house. Having found his seat and being wrapped in
his feather mantle by Suso, he asked the youth to play the
flute again. Huathia was ready and willing, but somehow
the memory of the two-headed toad and the two white snakes
made him nervous, and when he put his flute to his lips no
sweet sounds came, but instead rude noises like the hissing
of snakes and the croaking of frogs and the screeching of
parrots. Even Suso stopped her ears and her father bade
the youth cease his noise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you of those who make my last days the wearier
with your noises?” he asked sorrowfully. Then he added:
“For many nights I have dreamed of toads with two heads
and of snakes that hung over me, and now you come with
your flute and the noises that such evil things make. I had
expected better of you, Huathia, seeing that I have treated
you as a son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Huathia earnestly assured him that he had no wish to
do other than to make music, and he ended by saying:
“There is, I am sure, some enchantment in this place, for
though the sun is warm I feel a chill, as if some clammy
thing enfolded me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shivered as he spoke, though he was a lad whose blood
ran warm; not afraid, not given to idle fancies. Of a sudden
his eyes fell upon a large grindstone that lay near by.
It was a stone so great that two men could hardly make
shift to raise it, and so it had been left there for years and
grasses had grown about it. But when Huathia saw it,
there leaped into his mind the song that he had heard:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“The toad, our queen, lies hid unsought</p>
<p class='line0'>Beneath the stone that men have wrought.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>It had meant little in the night, but in a flash he saw that
the grindstone was a stone wrought by men. So fitting an
arrow to his bow he handed the weapon to Suso, telling her
to shoot whatever evil thing was discovered when he lifted
the stone. With a great effort he raised the stone suddenly,
heavy though it was, lifting it high above his head, and
there, in a hollow place where the stone had been, sat a
large, white, double-headed toad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shoot, Suso, shoot!” commanded the father. “Let not
that evil thing escape. It is the creature that torments me
at night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swift flew the arrow and it pierced the body of the toad.
At the same moment there fell from the roof of the house
two monstrous white serpents where they had lain hidden.
Like lightning Huathia, having seized the bow, sent two
arrows flying, and each serpent was cut into halves. In
less than three moments three evil things died, and it was
like the sun coming from a cloud-veil, the way in which
joy came to that place. The weakness of the father fell
from him like a cloak. The bodies of the toad and the
snakes withered and shrivelled, and as a light breeze sprang
up, what was left of them was blown away as dust. There
were soft stirrings in the thicket and the whole world burst
into song. So both father and daughter knew then that the
witcheries were gone and the evil creatures vanished for
ever, and that all the trouble that had been upon that place
came from the wicked stepmother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So youth and maiden were married, and the father soon
regained his health and strength, and in all the world there
were no happier people than they.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>THE TALE OF THE LAZY PEOPLE</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/I.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='I'/>N Colombia, it seems, there were always monkeys,
or if not always, at least as far as the memory of man
goes. An old historian named Oviedo noted that and
wrote: “When the Christians make an expedition to the interior
and have to pass by woods, they ought to cover themselves
well with their bucklers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the monkeys
throw down nuts and branches at them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I knew
one, a servant. This man threw a stone at a monkey, who
caught it and returned it with such force that it knocked
out four or five of Francisco’s teeth, and I know this to be
true for I often saw the said Francisco, always without his
teeth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now one day a man told me the tale of the monkeys, and
he talked and talked as he smoked, until the stars came out
and shone clear and steady and the air was heavy with perfume,
and owls and bats floated strangely, as they will do,
and when he had finished he still talked, taking up forgotten
ends of his tale and winding in and about, making a long
affair of a short matter. But then he had nothing else to
do but to talk and was mighty pleased, it seemed, to have
someone to listen to him. Then, when we should have been
sleeping, he went on talking, picking out a piece of the tale
here and another piece there, and explaining until I was
well nigh like to get the story tangled myself. But here
is the meat of it:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long, long ago there were no monkeys, and the trees
were so full of fruit, and the vines of grapes, that the people
became lazy, and at last did little but eat and sleep, being
too idle to carry away the rinds and skins of the fruit that
they lived on, and certainly too lazy to clean their thatched
houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was very pleasant at first, but soon not so pleasant, for
winged things that bit and stung came in thousands to feed
on the things thrown aside, and they, too, grew lazy, finding
so much to eat ready at hand, and when people tried to
brush them away there was a loud and angry buzz and much
irritated stinging, so that soon every one was wonder-struck,
not knowing exactly what to do. For a time it seemed
easier to move the little village to a new spot and to build
new houses, for the dwellings were light affairs and in a day
or less a good house could be built. But then they lived by
a lake from which the water for drinking was taken, and
as it was but a little body of water, it was not long before
the people had built right round the still pool and so were
back again at the starting place. As for the stinging flies,
they were soon worse than the mosquitoes, while a great
wasp with pink head and legs and bands of black and gold
on its body, though very pretty to see, was worst of all. So
it was no easy matter to know what to do, and there was
much talk and much argument, and all that the people
agreed on was that something had to be done, and that, very
soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day there came to the village a queer and rather faded
kind of man, ragged and tattered and torn as though he had
scrambled for miles through the thorn-bush forest. He
had rough yellow hair, and queer wrinkles at the corners
of his eyes which made him look as if he were smiling. It
was late in the afternoon when he came and the people were
taking their rest after the noon meal, so no one took much
notice of him although he went here and there, looking at
things, and so walked round the lake. But the curiosity of
everyone was excited when he was seen to make a basket,
which he did quickly, and then commence to gather up the
fruit skins and rinds in one place. Now and then some
one or other raised himself in his hammock, with a mind
to talk to him, but it seemed almost too much trouble,
and when some great blue-winged butterfly fluttered past or
some golden-throated humming-bird flashed in the sunlight,
their eyes wandered away from the old man and they forgot
him again. So the sunlight died and the forest was a
velvet blackness and everyone slept, though the old man
still worked on, and the next morning when the people
awoke he was still working diligently, though he had but
a small place cleared after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very thought that any one would work all night
made the head man shiver with a kind of excitement, yet he
was very curious to know why the stranger went to so much
trouble, seeing that he neither lived there nor was of the
lake men. At the same time it made his spirit droop to
think that if the place was to be cleared up, he and everyone
else had a mountain of work in sight. So Tera, the
head man, called to Cuco, who was his servant, telling him
to bring the stranger to him, and Cuco, who was very respectful,
said that he would attend to it. Then Cuco did
his part by calling Yana and delivering the message to him.
And Yana in turn told his servant, Mata, who told his servant,
Pera, who told his servant, Racas, who told a boy, so
that at last the message reached the old man. Then back
went the old man, handed by the boy to Racas, by Racas to
Pera, by Pera to Mata, by Mata to Yana, and by Yana to
Cuco, so that at last he stood before Tera, the head man, and
the others, being curious to know what was afoot, gathered
about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your name, from where do you come, and what
do you want?” asked Tera, putting his three questions at
once, to save trouble. Then the head man looked at those
about him with a little frown, as much as to say, “Note how
wisely I act,” and each man who had heard, seeing that the
head man looked his way, nodded at his neighbour, as
though calling attention to the wisdom of the head man, so
all went very well. But the little old man stood there very
simply, making no fuss at all and quite unimpressed with
the greatness of the great man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to work,” he answered. “I want to be told what
you want done and to see that it is done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be sure, the language that he spoke was one new to
those who listened, but somehow they seemed to understand.
But the thing that he said they found truly astonishing and
could hardly believe their ears. But the head man, though
as astonished as any one there, quickly regained his composure
and asked this question:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your trade?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no trade,” said the old man. “But I get things
done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All kinds of things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean big things, like house-building and all
that?” asked the head man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. And little things too, which are really big things
when you come to consider,” said the old man, but that
seemed an odd if not a silly thing to say, the head man
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little things left undone soon become big things,” explained
the old man, and waved his hand in the direction of
a heap of fruit skins and husks near by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Yes. But you must not preach to us, you know,”
said Tera a little testily. “Tell me the names of the trades
you have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the little old man began to tell, naming big things and
very little things, things important and things not important
at all, and having finished, asked very politely whether any
one there had anything to be done. As for pay he said that
he wanted none at all and would take none, and he said that
because some of those gathered about him began offering
him things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For instance, Pera said: “If you work for me, I will let
you have one fish out of every ten that you catch, for I am
a fisherman.” And Racas pushed him aside, saying: “But
I will do better, for I am supposed to be fruit gatherer and
will give you two things for every ten you gather.” And
so it went, each bidding higher than his neighbour, until it
came to the turn of the man whose duty it was to gather the
rinds and fruit skins. He said, “I will let you have, not
one out of ten, nor two out of ten, nor five out of ten that
you gather, but ten out of ten, if you will work for me.”
At that the old man said quite positively that he would
take no pay at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No more was said then and the little old man turned away
without as much as bowing to the head man, seeing which
the head man waved his hand and said: “You may go, and so
that you will lose no time, you need not bow to me.” And
all the rest gathered there said very hastily: “Nor need you
bow to me, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man took small notice of any one, but went away
singing, for he had a gay, light-hearted disposition, and
having reached the place he had cleared, he took flat pieces
of wood and began cutting out figures like little men, and
each figure had a kind of handle that looked like a long tail.
Nor did he cease whittling until he had made at least twenty
wooden figures for each man in the village. Being finished
he stood up to stretch his legs and straighten his back, and
when the people asked him what the little figures were for,
he shrugged his shoulders but spoke never a word. Then
he lifted the figures that he had made, one by one, and set
them upright in the sand until there was a long row of them,
and took his place in front of them, like a general before
his army. It was beautiful to look at, for one figure was as
like another as one pin is like another, and for a moment
even the old man stood admiring the line. After a moment
he waved his hand in a peculiar way, spoke some magic
word, and waved his hand again, at which each of the figures
came to life and nodded its head, seeing which all the
people laughed and clapped their hands. The ragged man
bade them make no noise, but watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since you do not like to work,” he said, “I have made
twenty figures for each of you, and they will work for you
without pay, doing what you require them to do; only observe
this, you must not give any figure more than one particular
job. And now let each man or woman clap his hands
three times, then call out the name of the thing to be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had said this, the figures started running, twenty
gathering in a circle about each man there, bowing from
the hips and straightening themselves again, so that their
tails of wood went up and down like pump-handles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now see,” said the ragged man, “you have things to
work for you, and as I call out, the figures will stand forth,
each ready to do his task.” And he began calling, thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Armadillo hunters, stand forth!” and a hundred and
more active figures ran together like soldiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he named others in order as:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bread makers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cassava gatherers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despolvadores, who would gather up dust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Esquiladors, who would shear the goats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farsante men, whose work was to amuse tired men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Guardas, to keep order about the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horneros, or bakers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Industriosos, who were to do odd jobs everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jumentos, whose work it was to carry burdens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Labradores, to do heavy work and clear away garbage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moledores, to grind the corn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Narradores, who told stories, related gossip and so on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olleros, or pot makers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pocilga figures, to attend to the pigs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Queseros, to make cheese from goat’s milk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rumbosos, or proud-looking things to walk in parades.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Servidores, or food carriers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trotadores, to run errands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vaqueros, to attend to the cows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So everyone was well pleased and each one had his twenty
figures to do all that needed to be done, and all that day
there was a great scraping and cleaning and carrying and
currying and hurrying and scurrying. Silently the little
figures worked, never stopping, never tiring, never getting
in one another’s way, and all that the living people had to
do was to rest and watch the men of wood, and keep their
brains free for higher things. For it must be remembered
that before the old man came there with his wonderful gift,
the people had complained that there was so much to be
done that they had no time to write poems or to make songs
or to create music, and that with the daily tasks abolished
their brains would be more active.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not two days had passed before the children of the place
complained that they did not have a chance and that they
had so much to do, what with hunting for things lost, looking
after their small brothers and sisters, keeping things in
order, trying to remember things they were told, cleaning
things, and a dozen other tasks, that they really had no time
to play, much less to study. So they went in a body to the
old man and asked him to give each child twenty figures to
do odd things. There was a great deal of fire and expression
in his eyes when he made answer that if the children
really needed help he would lose no time in providing it.
But the young people were quite positive that they were
overworked, and the long and short of it was that the old
man whittled out many, many more figures, and in another
twenty-four hours each and every boy and girl had his own:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abaniquero, or fan maker, so that none had to pluck a
palm leaf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baliquero figure, to carry letters and messages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cabrero, to look after the goats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desalumbrado, to hunt for things in the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Enseñador, or private teacher, who was never to scold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florista, to save them the trouble of gathering flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Guasón figure, to amuse them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hojaldarista, whose work it was to make cakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Juego figure, to arrange games.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keeper of things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lector, to read and tell stories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mimo, to act as clown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Niñera, to look after younger children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Obediencia figure, to make others obey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Postor, to buy things for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quitar figures, to take things away when children tired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Recordación figures, or rememberers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Solfeadors, to sing to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tortada men, to make pies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Volantes, as servants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So things seemed to be going very well, and before a
month had passed in all that place there was not a thing out
of order, soiled, broken, bent, lost, misplaced, undone, unclean,
or disorderly. Neither man nor woman nor child
had to worry; dinners were always prepared, fruits gathered,
beds made, houses in perfect order, and all was spick
and span. All that the grown-up people had to do was to
look on, and no one was proud of the order in his house
because every other house in the place was as orderly. As
for the children, they had nothing at all to do but to eat,
drink, rest, and sleep. Then, presently, more figures were
called for as this one or that wanted a larger house, a finer
garden, or grander clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as the wooden figures became more numerous and as
no figure could do more than one task, the ragged man had
to make figures for the figures and servants for the servants,
for as things went on, there had to be more fruit gatherers,
more water carriers, more scavengers, more cooks, because
the figures had to eat and drink. Thus it came to pass that
before long, instead of their being twenty figures for each
man, there were sixty or seventy, with new ones coming
from the old man’s knife every day. Soon the lively manikins
were everywhere, inside houses as well as outside,
thick as flies in summer and certainly a great deal more
persistent, for there could be no closing of doors against the
manikins. Indeed, had anything like that been attempted
there would have been a great cry for special door-openers.
So, many houses were quite cluttered with wooden men,
those who were on duty rushing about until it made the
head swim to look at them, and those who were resting or
sleeping, for soon they learned to rest and to sleep, lying
about the floors, piled up in corners, or hanging to rafters
by their tails. All that increase in help had made for the
production of a thousand or more guardas, whose task it
was to keep order, and they were everywhere, alert and
watchful and officious, and the real people had to step
about very gingerly sometimes, to avoid treading on them
and annoying them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last there came a day when the people began to grow
a little tired of doing nothing, and they told one another that
a little help was a very good thing, but help in excess, too
much of a good thing altogether. So there was a meeting
and much talk and the manikin narradors, whose duty it
was to carry gossip and the news, were very busy, rushing
from here to there with their scraps of information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very clear that something must be done,” said
Tera, the head man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But everything <span class='it'>is</span> being done,” answered the little old
man. “If <span class='it'>everything</span> is done, something <span class='it'>must</span> be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not mean that,” said Tera, who seemed a little
testy. “I meant to say that these wooden men must be kept
in their places.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they <span class='it'>are</span> in their places,” replied the old man.
“Their place is everywhere because they do everything, so
they are in their places.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, the days are so very long, so very dull,” said
the man who wished to have time that he might become a
poet. “At the shut of day we are not weary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do not want to be petted,” said another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trouble is,” sighed a fat man, “you can’t be happy
when everything is done for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we don’t want to be nobodies,” shouted another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another said very mournfully: “It seems to me that
when these wooden things do things with our things, then
the things that they do and make and care for are not our
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too many ‘things’ in that speech,” said the fat man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there are too many things,” answered the other.
“Look at me. I used to be gardener and now I’m nothing.
When my garden is dug and planted and tended and watered
and the very flowers plucked by these wooden things, and
when other wooden things pick up the leaves and pull the
weeds and do everything, then my garden does not seem to
be mine.” He added after awhile: “I hope you know what
I mean, because it is not very clear to me, yet it is so. I
remember——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that the little old man put up his hand and said: “But
that is against the contract. You must not try to remember,
really you must not, because there are manikins to do all
the remembering, if you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but I think——” began the man, when he was
again interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please do not think,” said the little old man. “We
have things to do the thinking, if you please.” He thought
for a moment, his bent forefinger on his lips, then he said:
“I’ll see what can be done. It is clear that you are not
satisfied, although you have everything that you asked for
and certainly all the time that you want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us do something,” murmured Tera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid there is nothing that you can do,” said the
little old man, “because, as you see, everything is done, and
when everything is done it is quite clear that something
cannot be left to be done. The only thing that is clear is
that there is nothing to be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that the meeting broke up and each went to his own
hammock to think things over, and soon the general cry
was: “We must have elbow room.” And hearing that, the
little old man went to work and whittled more figures of
wood, a whole army of them, ten for each living man,
woman, and child, and in voices that creaked like wooden
machinery they marched hither and thither, crying: “Elbow
room. Elbow room!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon there was confusion. It was manikin against manikin
for a time, the Elbow-room-ers thrusting and pushing
the other working manikins, some going about their
work with frantic haste, others interfering with them,
clutching at them and at the things they carried, a tangled
knot of them sometimes staggering, to go down with a
crash. Soon in every house was a jangling tumult, manikins
and men running about in houses and dashing out into
the open spaces outside; the noise of slamming doors and
breaking pots; the clamour of animals. Above all could be
heard everywhere cries of “We want elbow room! We
want elbow room!” Soon men were running away from
the houses with those strange swift manikins hanging to
them sometimes beating them, while other manikins
threw things out of the doors and through windows, food
and household things. And excited children fled too, while
their manikins ran at their sides, some chattering, some
acting the clown as was their duty, some telling stories as
they ran, while other strange little figures of wood ran
bearing heavy burdens. It was all a dreadful mix-up with
no one knowing what to do, no one knowing where to go,
and everywhere the manikins who were guardas, or order
keepers, ran about, tripping people and manikins alike in
the effort to stop the rush. But when the day was near its
end there were no people in the houses and the hammocks
swung idly, for all the men and women and children, even
the white-haired grandfathers and grandmothers, had fled
to the further side of the lake, where they could have elbow
room, leaving the houses and all that was in them to the
manikins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day, the people plucked their fruit for themselves
and it seemed as though fruit was never sweeter.
The water that they carried from the lake tasted better and
cooler than water had for many a long day, and when night
came they were happily tired and slept well, without any
manikin to swing their hammocks and sing to them. And
in the morning they woke early to discover the pink and
gold of the sunrise most wonderful to see, and there was
music in the sound of the wind among the grasses. So as
the day passed they were both amazed and astonished at the
wonderful and beautiful things that they had almost forgotten,
the sight of butterflies fluttering from flower to
flower, the shadows chasing across the hills, the richness of
the green earth and the blueness of the sky, the gold of sunlight
on the leaves, the rippling water and the bending trees;
indeed the memory of the manikin days was like a fearful
nightmare. Very light-hearted then they grew and the
world was full of the music of their laughter and song, and
briskly they worked, enjoying it all, building new houses
and making things to put in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile in the village things had gone queerly. For
one thing the Elbow-room-ers kept up their crowding and
pushing, so that the manikins trying to work at their old
tasks (and there were many who went on just as before) were
sadly hindered. There were other figures of wood with
nothing to do, since the people they served were gone, and
these fell to quarrelling among themselves and grew mischievous.
For instance, the pot makers and the pot cleaners
fell out, and the pot cleaners started to break the pots
so that the pot makers would have more work to do. That
meant that the clay gatherers and the clay diggers had to
work harder, then because they worked harder, though to
be sure all their work meant nothing and was little more
than idle bustle, they grew hungrier and wanted more to
eat. Because of all that the fruit gatherers had more to do
and the water carriers had to work harder and the cassava
bread makers had to bake as they had never baked before.
That brought the fire builders into it, and of course the wood
gatherers also, for they too had to work harder and to eat
more, so still more work came on the food bringers. And
all the time the Elbow-room-ers rushed about, always in
groups of ten, driving and commanding, rushing on workers
and sweeping them aside. So everywhere were little
figures hurrying one after the other, going to and fro, busy
about nothing, quarrelling about nothing, fighting about
nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trouble came when the Elbow-room-ers interfered
with the dogs and the cats, the goats and the hens, pushing
and hustling them. For the animals, disliking all the disorder
and clatter, fell upon the manikins, workers and
idlers alike. Seeing that, the household utensils took a
hand and the very pots and kettles ran or rolled or fell,
spilling hot water over the wooden things with pump-handle
tails. The very embers from the fires leaped into
the fray. All the while from the metates in which the corn
had been ground came a low growling, and the growling
formed itself into words:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Day by day you tortured us—</p>
<p class='line0'>Grind, grind, grind.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Holi! Holi!</p>
<p class='line0'>Huqui! Huqui!</p>
<p class='line0'>Grind, grind, grind.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Bring to us the torturers—</p>
<p class='line0'>Grind, grind, grind.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Let them feel our power now—</p>
<p class='line0'>Grind. <span class='it'>Grind.</span> <span class='gesp'>GRIND!</span></p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>So the metates turned and turned, going round and round
without hands, and presently an Elbow-room-er that was
struggling with a corn-grinder stumbled, and both fell between
the grinding stones and in a moment were crushed
to powder. In a flash house utensils and animals learned
the new trick, and in every house manikins were pushed
into the grinding stones. Then sparks began to fly and
roofs to catch on fire and manikins bolted here and there
in confusion, sometimes jamming in doorways, there were
so many and all in such disorder. Then came dazzling,
flickering lightning and a great rain, so that for very safety
the manikins fled to the forest and climbed the trees. And
there they have lived ever since, for they grew hair and
became monkeys. But the remembrance of all that passed
stayed with them, and in their hearts to this very day is no
love for man, and for that very reason when a Christian
passes through a forest he must look well to himself, lest
the manikins in revenge try to hurt him by casting nuts
and branches at his head.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>RAIRU AND THE STAR MAIDEN</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/P.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='P'/>ERHAPS my friend Pedro of Brazil told me the
story of Rairu and the Star Maiden for much the
same reason that hungry men fall to talk of meals
that they have eaten. When I say hungry men I do not
mean men with an appetite, but men who have long been
on the verge of starvation—shipwrecked sailors, men lost
in the desert, and such like. The truth is that what the
heart hungers for, the tongue talks of. So my friend Pedro
told me many tales of his own warm land where spice-laden
breezes blow gently soft, and at the time he told me
his tales we two were in the midst of the snows of Tierra del
Fuego, when the winds shrieked like a thousand demons
and the frost-giant had bound river and lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were gold digging on the upper Santa Maria and
there came without warning a fierce blizzard, the snow
falling for the best part of two days and two nights, and
in the morning we could not move from our tent, though we
had pitched it in a quiet nook of the hills. We had little
to eat, nothing to read, and no light but the fire-glow, and
the world seemed to narrow about us, the mountains to
close in and the leaden sky to drop. And all the while
Pedro talked of his gentler land, telling me the glory of hills
all purple and green, of sunlit waters and flower-crowned
children. So, soon we forgot the black south wind and the
destroying cold. Pedro half forgot, I think, that hope
which led him to the Far South; it was a hope long cherished,
that he might find gold enough to enable him to live
in quiet in his own land among the books that he loved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, you may think this wearisome talk, judging it
better that I tell the tale told by Pedro. But I have felt
it best to set it down as I have, because Pedro never saw
his own land again; so the writing of the story is in some
measure done in affection for my friend. As soon as the
snow ceased to fall he went away on foot, our horses having
wandered before the storm, and his intention was to win
his way to a shack some eight miles away where he might
get some food which we needed sorely enough. I in the
meantime, we agreed, would take my rifle and try to shoot
a huanaco or some other thing. But another storm came
on and it was not until five days had passed in search that I
found Pedro. And he was frozen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I write I see the scene again—the snow-swept hills,
the gray sky, the white-laden bushes, and Pedro. I made
what haste I could to bury him in the ice-bound earth and
put up a rough cross to mark the place, and I had barely
finished when a white storm swept up and hid both mound
and cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is the tale he told, one of many, and he said that he
had heard it often and often when he was a child.</p>

<h3><span class='it'>The Tale</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Of all things, nothing pleased Rairu more than to watch
the ways of the living things of the forest, to bend over a
flower and drink in its beauty, to lie by the side of a leaf-hidden
pool and follow some shaft of sunshine as it shot to
the depth, or to stand breathless when a wild bird broke into
song. His father, very bitter against what he deemed idleness,
often said harsh things, telling Rairu that he would do
well to attend to matters more enduring. Still, Rairu was
what he was. Before the sunlight came over the world he
would seek the forest deeps and there, hidden in green
thickets, would lose himself in the music of the birds. And
as time passed and Rairu grew into young manhood another
joy came to him, and the glory of the star-sprinkled
sky filled him with wonder. Night after night he would
wait in a favourite place by a little cascade, a place bare of
trees, eagerly impatient for the soft light of the first star
in the violet sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Watching thus Rairu found a thought rise in his mind, a
thought that the world would be well only when that order
was among men which was in the skies. More, it seemed to
him that of all living creatures that walked the earth man
was the most destructive, the most wasteful, and the most
untrustful. Then one night as he lay at the foot of a palm
tree, his heart was full of gladness because of the song of a
night-bird, and it came to him somehow to believe that the
stars sang to the bird as the bird sang to the stars, so he
looked up to find, if possible, which star heard that bird, and
he saw one that hung low, one far more beautiful than her
fellows. Thereafter, when the sky grew soft and dark, his
eyes sought the Silver One and he waited until the night-bird
sang. Like jewels, like living sparks of sound, the
music went up, and like a maiden the Silver One listened.
When the star dropped in the west and the song-bird ceased,
then Rairu was sad and alone, alone as one in a seagirt land
whom none may visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, it was a day of cloud-flecked sky and humming
life, Rairu met an old man, thin-haired and bearded, and the
stranger hailed him, calling him by name. After some
talk, much of which seemed riddlesome to the lad, the old
man asked him what of all things, had he his wish, would
he choose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After thinking awhile, Rairu said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the Silver One would come from her place in the sky
and go with me so that I might admire her beauty both day
and night, I would be the happiest man on earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that, the old man bade Rairu go to sleep that
night on a high hill which was not far away. “And,” said
he, “if it be that you desire the Silver One for her beauty
alone and not that others may envy you in your possession,
then it may be that your wish shall be granted.” No more
he said, but walked away, singing to himself softly as he
went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that day Rairu spent in the forest, eager for the night
and the stars, and in the noonday heat sat in the shade of
the trees with eyes fast closed, trying to make a song in
which he might tell the world of the Silver One and her
great beauty, for it vexed him that so few looked to her;
but no words came to him to satisfy. Only this, which he
thought but a poor thing:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>When men sorrow and rage,</p>
<p class='line0'>When the hearts of men grieve,</p>
<p class='line0'>When arrows of sharp words wound,</p>
<p class='line0'>When there is none to pity pain,</p>
<p class='line0'>In the order of heaven there is sweet delight.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>In the night hushed and still,</p>
<p class='line0'>When is neither weeping nor laughter,</p>
<p class='line0'>In the night-time between two empty days,</p>
<p class='line0'>The Silver One is riding in the sky</p>
<p class='line0'>Singing hand in hand with her sister stars,</p>
<p class='line0'>Singing, because the life of men is an empty dream.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>When darkness was about to spread he went up the rocky
path to the hilltop, as the old man had bidden him, and lay
there looking at the opal fires in the western sky, watching
the change to sea-green and gold, from orange to pink, and
waiting, waiting until the stars should come forth. Now and
then he sang the lines of the song he had made, the last lines:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>In the night-time between two empty days,</p>
<p class='line0'>The Silver One riding in the sky</p>
<p class='line0'>Singing hand in hand with her sister stars,</p>
<p class='line0'>Singing, because the life of men is an empty dream.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>When at last the stars pricked the dark, great was his
grief to find that the Silver One was not among them. He
searched well, thinking that she hid perhaps behind a leaf,
but soon he knew that her sisters went their way alone.
Long and long he looked, and at last, wearied and sad at
heart, fell asleep, weeping that he had lost the thing to him
most dear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he slept he dreamed that the earth was bathed in a
great white light, a light that was both light and music, at
which he became wonderfully happy. He dreamed that
he was lifted up as on a cloud, lifted up high into the
heavens and could see, far below him, countless sweetly
turning spheres of light; and across great dark spaces and
gulfs of blackness were other and new stars; and from the
edge of nothingness to the edge of nothingness all was a-tune.
Still, for all that, his heart was heavy, because in all that
stardust there was no Silver One. What was most strange
was this: though his heart was heavy, yet a joy was in him,
a sad joy for that he felt himself as a tight-stretched golden
string that quivered in tune with the music all about. So
he awoke and saw standing by his side a maiden clothed in
white, whose eyes looked into his heart with deep love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arise, Rairu,” said she, “for I have come to cheer and
to comfort. I am the Silver One and you may keep me
with you.” So saying she became small, small but none the
less beautiful, so small indeed that she might have stood
in the palm of Rairu’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Rairu was the happiest of mortals. He cast about
him for a casket in which to keep his treasure, but finding
none worthy, bethought him of his gourd, a thing which he
had carved and adorned with much excellent skill. Having
cleaned it well, so well that not a grain of dust was in it, he
set it on the ground on its side in a clean place and the
Silver One stepped into it, resting lightly on a bed of
light-green moss. All that day Rairu went about, now and
then taking the cover from the gourd to look within and
gaze with delight at the eyes of the Silver One looking up
at him. Whenever he did that, from the gourd there came
a sound of melting music, so entrancing a sound that Rairu
felt himself to be a part of all things—a part of the very
heavens and the stars and the sun and the moon. Even of
the forest with its animals and birds, its trees and its pools,
he was a part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day and night strange things the Silver One told Rairu,
and of those things that which he found most sad was her
telling that when the day came on which he took his eyes
from her and thought of other things on which she would
not look, things which hid from her in dark places and
under roofs, then there would be a dividing and she would
become to him but as an aching memory. At that Rairu,
after pondering awhile, always laughed, telling her that no
sword could sever the thread that bound them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a day when the Silver One told Rairu that it
would be well if they visited the sky-world for a season,
and to do that Rairu was quite willing. So at her bidding
Rairu sat among the leaves of a palm tree and the Silver
One crept out of the gourd and took her place by his side.
With a little stick she touched the tree, and at that it grew
rapidly, grew until it carried them into a place all bare
and treeless, without birds or flowers. The Silver One told
Rairu to wait a while and she would return. She sped
away and Rairu kept her in his sight, for her light did not
dim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon, to his astonishment he saw, close at hand, a beautiful
city with shining towers and moving lights of many
colours, and about it went a joyful procession of young men
and maidens, dancing and singing and playing instruments.
Many beckoned to him to follow them, which he did. Soon
he came to a great hall, and as he entered a great burst of
music sounded, whereupon all there fell to dancing, whirling
wildly. Wilder and more wild grew the music; it became
a welter of sound, a boiling flood of strange noise that
set his brain on fire. From corners leaped evil and ugly
things, bats, swine, evil-eyed carrion-birds, blunt-tailed and
mud-coloured serpents and great white toads, soft and
clammy. In the wild dance they joined and the din grew
louder, so that it seemed to Rairu that his ears must crack.
But more fearful things there were, so that Rairu fled to
the place where he had stood when the Silver One left him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was there waiting for him, but her eyes, though still
full of love, were filled with sad tears. Very gently she
chided him for his disobedience, and Rairu hung his head
in sorrow and shame, knowing that he must leave the Silver
One for a season. It needed no words to tell that the
thread was broken. Hand clasped hand then, the more
passionately because they knew that there would be a parting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go then, Rairu,” said she. “But mind well that a little
toil, a little striving, and thou shalt find me again. In the
darkness lean on me, the more because thou knowest thyself
to be weak. Under the shadow of death, dear Rairu,
a fainting love is revived.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Rairu returned to earth, but great was his desire to
find again that which he had lost. And he told his fellow-men
of all that he had seen, saying that he must again find
his star. Soon, with searching, he found his Silver One and
the clear light led him, clothing all that he said and did
with beauty.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>THE CAT AND THE DREAM MAN</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img class='dropcap' src='images/T.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='T'/>HIS is a tale that I heard when I was gold digging
in Tierra del Fuego, and if you want to get to the
tale and skip the introduction, you may. To do
that, stop here—and pass over everything until you come to
the three stars *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and begin at “Many years ago.”
But if you want information and all that kind of thing, read
straight on and learn that the man who told me the tale was
named Soto, Adolpho Soto. He called himself a Bolivian
and said that it was a tale of Bolivia, but he had never been
to that country. His parents were Bolivian, but he had
been born and reared in inland Patagonia, on the east side
of the Cordilleras and north of the great shallow gulf that
runs inland from the Strait of Magellan. Anyway, he
had heard the tale from others who knew all about the three
great stones and how they looked. Certainly he had not
read the story, for books meant nothing to him and he would
not as much as look at a picture. And it was quite clear
to me that he believed every word of the tale. Indeed, I
am almost sure that he was doubtful in his mind as to the
wisdom of telling me all of it, thinking that I would not
believe it. Perhaps that is why he told me the tale in two
parts, as if in some manner I might thus get used to the shock
of it. Mind you, on the other hand, I am certain that he
did not believe all that I told him, though he was too polite
to express unbelief. For instance, he could not quite see
how carriages went without horses, nor how men sent messages
over miles of wire, nor how the sound of a human
voice could come from a little box, without magic; for in
the country that Adolpho came from there were no railways,
no telegraphs, and no phonographs. So to the tale,
or rather the first part of it, if you choose to hear it.</p>

<h3><span class='it'>The First Part</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Many years ago, said Soto, there came into the world a
cat. It was in the days when all creatures were harmless;
when the teeth and claws of the jaguar did not hurt; when
the fang of the serpent was not poisonous; when the very
bushes had no thorns. But this cat was of evil heart and
unmerciful and a curse to the world, for she went about
teaching creatures to scratch and to bite, to tear and to kill,
to hide in shady places and leap out on unsuspecting things.
Even a sheep she did not leave to its own ways, but commenced
to teach that gentle thing to fight by butting with
its head, though as it came to pass most luckily, the cat came
to a place where its mischief was stopped, as you shall hear
soon, so that señor sheep was left with his lesson half or less
than half learned, so that the youngest child now need not
fear a whole flock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for the most part the cat slept in the daytime, so did
not make all the mischief that she might have made, although
she dreamed mischief, let it be remembered. But
this was the bad thing of it: her dream came to life and
walked the earth in the shape of a man with a fox-face, and
a very terrible monster was he, for being a dream man he
could not be killed. That you may see for yourself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes he appeared among men, dressed in fine robes
in a way of a rich man, clothes wonderfully fine, as fine as
those that you may see about the men pictured on the playing
cards. Sometimes it was otherwise and he came as
one all worn and travel-stained. Sometimes he came as a
head without a body, making mouths or looking slantwise;
sometimes he ran at people, did this dream man, ran with
hooked fingers and claw nails and made it so that the one
he chased could not run at all, or running, moved but
slowly. For such must be the nature of the dreams of
cats, as everyone knows who has seen a cat with a mouse.
But whichever way the dream man came, mischief of some
kind walked with him, and for the most part he did his evil
work by granting men their wishes. For you must know
that no man knows the thing that is best for him and for his
welfare, and many are apt to see some little things as desirable,
the which in time work out for their own undoing.
Thus, once there was a man who was a woodcutter, and
growing weary of hard work he sat him down under a tree
and sighed, saying that though he worked hard, yet his
work was never done, and there were many mouths to feed.
Then who should appear before him but the fox-faced man,
which of course was but the cat-dream come to life, the cat
meantime being asleep in the sun. So this happened:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you complain?” asked the fox-faced one, who
knew very well what was afoot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All day I cut and chop, and chop and cut, but at the
end of the day little is the work that I have done, and my
very children for whom I toil, and for whom my wife toils,
do but grumble that I am not rich,” answered the poor fellow,
who was indeed a very worthy man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky for you, then, is it that you have seen me,” said
fox-face. “For know that I have it in my power to grant
you a wish. What then would you have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that, the woodcutter was thoughtful, for, in the
manner of those who see a dream man, everything seemed
right and proper. Still, while he had in his life wished
for many things from day to day, when the time came to
make a wish he had none ready. Then his eye fell on his ax
and he said without thinking: “For one thing I wish that
my ax was an ax so that when I cut a stick or anything, I
would have two as big as the first one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be sure, had he given thought he might have seen how
foolish a wish was that, as both cat and fox-face knew. But
he spoke as the wind blew. Then fox-face said some words
which the woodcutter did not understand, and added: “Try
now your ax.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the man took a stick about the size of a man’s arm
and brought down his ax in the middle of it, and lo, there
were two sticks, each the size of a man’s arm, instead of two
pieces each the half of that. The man looked up, open-mouthed
and surprised, to say something, but fox-face had
vanished, for the cat had wakened and so her dream ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But greatly amazed was the man, for, as he soon saw, all
his chopping was of no account, for a tree cut down became
at once two trees and one of those trees cut in halves became
two trees again. As for cutting smaller wood, that, too,
soon became impossible, seeing that each stick grew to two
sticks, so that soon he had to cease work because of the wood
all about him. Worse still, as he went to the place where
he lived, there came across his path a poisonous serpent,
and forgetting for a moment the power of his ax he cut the
snake in two, and there, hissing before him, were two snakes.
So he fled to his people and told them the tale, at which
they wondered greatly. But to make sure that the ax would
do no mischief, and in truth somewhat fearing it, they hung
it in a tree, and each man told his son the story of it, so
that all might come to know it as a thing best left alone.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Now in the course of time there came to that place a very
wise man who had seen many wonders. It had come to his
ears that the cat was a creature of darkness, teaching harmless
things evil tricks, but of the fox-faced man he knew
nothing. The cat only, he considered. So the wise man
walked the mountains for many days, and one day when the
sky was low and it was a day of rain, an unpleasant day for
the cat, he came upon the evil-minded creature hurrying
somewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why in so great a hurry?” asked the wise man. “Sit
awhile with me and talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. No,” said the cat. “I like not your water and I
seek a place where there is shelter, so that I may be dry and
warm.” Indeed, the cat looked very miserable indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how would you like to have a house of stone?”
asked the wise man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I should like very much indeed,” answered the cat.
“But it must be a house large enough for me, and with no
room for any other creature, for I am not fond of company.
But a house in which I could sit and dream, and where no
noises might disturb, would be very pleasant. Make me
such a one and I shall teach you something. Or how about
a wish? Would you like to have claws like an owl? Or
would you like to drink blood like a vampire bat? Or
would you like to spit poison? Or would you like to
bristle like a porcupine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, no,” said the wise man. “I want nothing.
But by to-morrow there shall be a house ready for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is it to be built?” asked the cat. “First, it must
be in a quiet place where men do not go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall be that,” answered the wise man. “But just
now I do not know where the place may be. I must seek a
proper place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then how shall I find it?” asked the cat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Attend,” said the wise man. “I shall put a thread about
the world, a thread that no man may break with his hands,
and when you see that thread, follow it and so come to the
stone house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agreed,” said the cat. “But let the house be just big
enough for me. Let it be in a quiet place. Also, let it be
of such fashion that I can slip out backward or leap out forward
should an enemy come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So that being said and no more to come, man and cat parted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But mark well what followed. On the next day the cat
chanced to see the thread and followed it, walking down
hill and up hill, down mountain and up mountain, until
she arrived at a high place where stood the wise man. At
his feet were three flat stones, two standing upright, the
third across the top of the two, so that it was like two sides
of a little house, roofed and of a comfortable size for the
cat. So after looking about carefully and suspiciously, the
cat entered into it and coiled her tail about her, blinked her
eyes once, twice, thrice, then slept. And as soon as she was
well asleep the wise man fastened the thread about her
neck, the same thread which went about the world and
which no man could break with his hands, there being
magic about it, and señora cat was bound for years, and
would have been bound for ever, had it not been for Nasca,
about whom you shall hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That ends the tale of the cat, though there is much more
to come. And if you are in a hurry to get to the rest of the
tale, you may skip from this—to the three stars *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
again, without losing much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said that it ended the tale of the cat, but it does not.
It ends the first part only, for Adolpho went only thus far,
and the telling took the whole of an evening, for there was
much looping and winding in his telling and he added
much that had nothing to do with the tale. Indeed, you
should be very grateful indeed to me for trimming all the
uninteresting stuff away. And let me tell you this: it was
not at all easy to get Adolpho to tell the rest of the tale, and
the place in which we sat when we talked was not comfortable.
It was no house with radiators and electric lights,
or bathtubs and bookshelves. Indeed, the only furniture
that we had was a frying-pan without a handle and an
iron pot. As for our house, it looked more like a short
stout bottle than a dwelling. For the truth is that we were
careless builders and had made our house out of sods of
earth; but while we started to build a square house, we did
not take care of the corners, and the house came roundish
and the walls leaned inward as they went higher, so we left
the top open by way of chimney, for our fire was built in
the middle of the floor. Thus such was the shape of our
house that we had to sleep curved and we had to stand
curved, though we rarely stood, because of the smoke, I
assure you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost three weeks passed away before Adolpho told me
the rest of the tale and it was a cold night in June when
he did. After supper he commenced, perhaps because it
was the kind of stew that he liked best. For the most of
the stew was fish. I said “the most of the stew,” because
our stews were different from those you have. If on Monday
we had a piece of huanaco meat, we put it in the iron
pot to stew. There would be something left over, for we
always made a little more than we required and we never
wasted food. So, supper being done, the iron pot with the
remains of the stew was put aside. Perhaps next day we
might have caught or shot a young goose, or something like
that. Anyway, whatever we caught went into the pot by
way of stew. So that day there would be goose stew with
a flavour of huanaco. Next day we might add charqui,
which is dried horse-flesh, to the stew, so while the chief
thing would be charqui, there would be a decided flavour
of goose and more than a trace of huanaco. But if we had
fish on the fourth day, then of course it would be strongly
fishy stew, with a kind of side taste of charqui, a flavour of
goose, and a mild trace of huanaco. On the whole it was
satisfactory, for toward the end of the week any one might
find something to his liking, though on Saturday we always
cleaned out the pot, as we needed it for our week’s washing.
And so, as I say, when we came one evening to fish stew,
Adolpho was in high good humour and told me the rest of
the tale, and this is how his story ran.</p>

<h3><span class='it'>The Second Part of the Tale</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Now, began Soto, you must remember all that I have
told you about the cat bound on the mountain top, the magic
ax hanging in the tree, and the hundreds and hundreds of
years that passed, with the cat growing larger and larger. As
the cat grew, so did the house, for the wise man had promised
that it should be just big enough for the cat, and he kept
his word. But you must also remember that the cat could
not move, but could certainly dream. So she dreamed of
many lands, and the dream man was very active indeed,
though he vanished whenever the cat woke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When you come to think of it, you will see that it was a
most excellent thing that the cat was bound, for had she not
been, she would have worked her mischief on the world and
a sheep might have been as terrible as a wild boar or flies
as annoying as mosquitoes or horses as bold as wild bulls or
the very fish as poisonous as serpents. While the cat did
not dream, of course the fox-faced man was nowhere, and
then all went very well and trees put out their blossoms and
fruits, the grass was softly green, the rain was like silver,
and gentle were the hearts of men as they went about their
affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was a day on which the cat dreamed and the
fox-faced fellow was busy. To the place where lived the
people who guarded the magic ax, there came a stranger.
His eyes were aslant and little, the hair of him was reddish,
and he was in rags and tatters and altogether dirty in appearance.
To be sure, no one would look twice at rags and
tatters, for one coming through the forest must needs be torn
by thorns and bushes in all that tangle, but dirt was quite
another matter, especially when the dirt included blood
stains, because in that place was much water and many
running streams, nor was the water chill to the skin. So,
because of the uncleanness of the man, people looked at him
with unfriendly eyes, and though they were neither insolent
nor rude they hoped that he would go farther and not stay
there. Nor would it have been any great hardship for
him to do so, seeing that it was a place of much fruit and
of many berries, and roots pleasant to the taste and full of
nourishment. As for the night, any man might well stretch
himself under that star-sprinkled sky, nor except for the
beasts that the cat had made unfriendly were there creatures
to do harm. But the stranger had no notion of doing
anything to please the people, nor indeed could he do anything,
seeing that he was the creature of the cat’s dream,
walking the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a time then he stood under a tree bewailing his lot
and crying out that all the world was against him and saying
that none were kind to him. Strange things he did, too, as
is the manner of dream people, making himself sometimes
shoot far far away so that he looked small, then coming near
again and getting big, or sometimes pointing his finger at
someone, then throwing his arm round and round in great
circles, the finger always pointing, the circles he made
growing smaller and smaller, little by little, but his finger
always pointing, until it came close to the watcher’s eyes.
The people thought this an annoying thing for a stranger
to do; but so it was. And always he woefully wailed. So
those there stood about him in a little circle, none going
close, but all wondering much at the great outcry, the like
of which none there had heard before. Then he began to
sing, noisily, wildly. This was his song:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Over the world I walk,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Alone, for ever alone.</p>
<p class='line0'>Trouble and trial and care,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Alone, I bear alone.</p>
<p class='line0'>Torture and pain I bear,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Alone, for ever alone.</p>
<p class='line0'>Wandering day and night,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Alone, for ever alone.</p>
<p class='line0'>Sad and wretched my plight,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Alone, for ever alone.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Then he gave a long, long cry, like a wolf:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“A—a—a—a—a——lone, Oo—oo—oo—oo!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Nor did he stop at that, for his song done, he began to act
stupidly, leaping from side to side in rage and fury,
mouthing and grimacing, opening and closing his fists, but
making no noise. Then he talked again, but it was a
jabber of idle words, so presently those about him shook
their heads at one another, looking at him as one who had
lost his wits, never thinking of course that he was a cat’s
dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While all this was going on, there came from the little
lake where he had been fishing a lad named Nasca, bearing
a basket of fish, a happy fellow who always made music and
song as he walked, and seeing the people gathered about the
stranger he drew near. No sooner did the stranger clap
eyes on the fish than he leaped at the basket and began
devouring the silvery things, eating them raw, heads, bodies,
and tails, for thus ran the cat’s dream and cattishness must
out. But the meal being done, the stranger redoubled his
lamentations, all the time swinging his arm in circles, sometimes
great, sometimes small, with his finger pointed at the
boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A—a—a—a—a——lone, Oo—oo—oo—oo!” he
screamed, and the boy thought that such a fellow well deserved
to be alone, but he was too polite to say so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am hungry and travel-worn,” the stranger went on.
“Is there no one here who will give me shelter? Is there
no one in this place with a kind heart to pity me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that, the heart of Nasca was touched, for never
had he, nor never had his grandmother with whom he lived,
turned a hungry creature away empty. Indeed, so gentle
in spirit was Nasca that if the stem of a flower was broken
by a heedless creature he was full of grief. Yet the doings
of the stranger astonished him and troubled him, for the
man without seeming to move his feet thrust his face close
to the boy’s, then somehow took his face far off. That
silly trick he did again and again as dream creatures do, so
that seeing him Nasca was well nigh made dizzy. Then
the lad, blushing red as fire because of all the people thereabouts
who did not offer what he offered, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come home, then, with me. Our house is small but
there is room enough. Believe me, it is not that these
people are hard-hearted that they do not seem to welcome
you, but more because you must have been too weary with
walking to wash yourself. But behind the hill and under
a tree near where we live is a still pool, and there doubtless
you will clean yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Nasca led the way and the stranger went with him,
yet not walking, but leaping up and down as he went, and
sometimes not touching the ground at all. Nasca was not
comfortable with the stranger by his side, for he felt him
to be more like a shadow than a man, and a shadow that
hung over him and tormented him, a shadow that might
pounce upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having come to the place where his grandmother was,
Nasca was sorely troubled to see the old woman fall to
trembling when she heard the voice of the stranger, who
was making an idle jabber of words again. Indeed, after
a time she put her hands to her face and wept, though that
was after the man having eaten had left the place to rest
under a tree. Nasca comforted her as best he could, then
asked her to tell him the cause of her grief. Be it remembered
that she was very, very old and her eyes were
weak and dim with age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me,” she said, taking Nasca’s hand, “has this man
eyes aslant, like the eyes of a fox?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed and he has,” answered Nasca. Then his heart
bade him say some good of the fellow, and he added: “Yet
no man makes his own face, wherefore must some be pitied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me,” said the grandmother eagerly, “has he sharp
teeth like a cat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That he has,” said Nasca, then wondering, asked:
“Have you seen this man, then, when your eyes were bright
and strong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Nasca,” she answered, “never have I set eyes on
him, yet I greatly fear him; and long, long ago I heard
stories about such a creature and it was said that much evil
he wrought, yet none could slay him.” She was silent for
a little, then again she asked this: “Did you see his ears,
Nasca, and are they pointed, like those of a fox?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Nasca.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that answer the old woman was sad again and Nasca
had to comfort her with sweet words, telling her that she
should come to no hurt, since he was there, for he would
die defending her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I know, Nasca,” she said. “If the hurt came to
me alone, glad would I be, for I have seen my golden days
and now there is little left for me but the brief sunset hour.
But I fear for others. Of such a creature I have heard it
said that he comes from nowhere and goes into nothing,
but somehow looses evil upon men. Because of that I fear.
So, Nasca, promise me that if this man asks anything of
you, you will do nothing that promises hurt to any living
thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Nasca promised gladly enough, then said: “Yet it
may be that this man is not the evil creature you have
heard of. It may well be some unfortunate whose wits are
loose. True, his face is far from pleasant to see, but a rough
face may go with a good heart, and a man’s face may
change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, with wickedness,” said the old woman, “but in truth
it has been said that a man’s face and his character both go
with him to the grave, if indeed there is any grave for such
as this.”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Now all that talk Nasca remembered well the next day
when a strange thing happened. For the stranger went
about among the people, asking this one and that what he
most desired. But there were none to make a wish for a
time, because life there was pleasant and easy and the
possessions of men were few, so all that the stranger said
went for nothing. Then, as it chanced, there came one of the
people a little put out because he had lost sleep that morning.
He was a man much given to rest and slumber, a slow
and heavy man, and that morning he had been awakened
by the singing of the birds. To make matters worse, going
away from the place where he had lain, in too great a
hurry, he chanced to scratch himself on some thorns. So,
taking it all in all, his humour was not a pleasant one; yet
had it not been for the stranger, he might have forgotten his
troubles. As it was, he heard the stranger’s speech and the
offer to grant any wish, so he spoke without considering his
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you grant wishes, there is one that I would have,” he
said, nodding to his friends in the manner of one who had
a matter of weight to tell of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say it,” said the stranger, and he grinned queerly so that
his lip went up and his tusky teeth shone yellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This morning I was disturbed by birds and scratched by
thorns, so I wish that nothing might come near me to disturb
me in the future.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you wish,” said the stranger, and gabbled what
seemed to be idle and meaningless words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a strange thing happened, for as the man who had
made the wish stood looking at the stranger, his mouth
wide open, all living things about him suddenly fell away.
Within the stretch of a man’s arm from him the grass
yellowed and died, and the flowers shrank and withered,
and a butterfly that fluttered over him fell to earth, dead.
And the people cried out, seeing that, but soon it became
clear that not even sounds could come within that magic
circle. The air bore no noise to the charmed man, not even
the sweet noise of the songs of birds nor the chirping of
insects, and the man was, in very truth, in such case that
nothing could be nigh him to disturb him. Indeed, as he
moved, all things died within the stretch of his arms, seeing
which his friends fled from him, all fearful of his nearness.
Afraid of his loneliness the man walked to a tree, but no
sooner did he touch it than the very leaves folded themselves
and turned black, then dropped off and fluttered down, so
that the arms of the good tree stood skeleton-bare against
the sky. At that all hope in the man was gone and he
turned and fled into the forest, a space opening before him
as he ran, a track of death everywhere behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nasca saw all that, and his grandmother’s fears came to
his mind. Indeed, he told many there of what the old
woman had said, but some of them held that the stranger
had but granted the wisher his wish, and if there was fault
in the matter the fault lay with the wisher, not with the
granter of the wish. As for the grandmother, when she
heard the tale she was in great trouble and threw herself
on the ground weeping, and though Nasca did what he
could to comfort her, yet she wept and wept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nasca,” she said presently, “surely we must do what we
can to rid the place of this fearful creature. For it is as I
thought, and he is a black-hearted thing, not of this world
of men, and one who will assuredly bring hate and fear and
trouble. Find, then, if there is any means by which he may
be made to go away, even to the point of helping him, if need
be, but see to it that you think not of yourself and your own
gain, and see to it that anything that you do at his request
will bring no harm to any living creature, even the smallest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this Nasca promised, and in the early dawn of the
next day went up to the hills to see the sun rise, as indeed
did all brave and strong men and fair maidens in that place.
Then he swam a little while, and ate some fruit and thought
a while, and after sought out the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stranger,” said he, “be it known to you that there are
many here who fear your presence among us and who would
be glad to see you gone from here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho! Ho! What bold words are these I hear?” roared
fox-face, full of wrath at Nasca’s words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I speak but the truth,” said the lad boldly enough, though
his heart beat against his ribs. “Tell me, then, what can be
done so that you may be persuaded to leave us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fox-face thought awhile, then he said: “On a far mountain
is a gentle creature bound with a magic thread which
no man’s hand can break. Yet magic fights magic, and the
magic ax can sever the thread. Also, at the moment the
thread is cut, so will the man who is prisoned in air be free,
but not before. Now the bound creature is my companion
and no fierce thing at all. Come with me, Nasca, bringing
the magic ax, and when you have seen the cat, then perchance
shall the spell be broken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All of that seeming fair to Nasca, he went to the tree
where hung the magic ax, though he had much ado to
climb through the tangle all about the tree, for no man had
been there for many a year. He took the ax and fastened
it well in his sash, and returned to the side of the stranger.
Then fox-face took a mat made of feathers of the night owl
and the hair of the skunk, and spread it on the ground, but
it was so small that there was scarce place for Nasca and
the man too, so the lad cut it with the magic ax and there
were two mats, which was more to Nasca’s taste, for he had
no liking to stand on the mat and hold on to fox-face. No
sooner had they taken their places on the mats than they
rose in the air, and in a swift moment both of them were so
high that the country lay spread at their feet with trees like
grass and with rivers that looked like silver threads. Nor
could the swiftest condor move with the speed with which
they flew through the air. So at last they came to a place
where everywhere were bare rocks and hard stone, with no
blade of grass to be seen, and it was a place among mountain
peaks, with stony ridge rising above stony ridge, and
on a mountain peak the two rested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now look away to the far hill,” said the stranger, and
while the place to which he pointed was very far off, yet
because of the clearness of the air it seemed but a short
distance away. Looking steadily Nasca saw the three great
rocks, for they were tremendously grown now, after so many
hundreds of years, but to Nasca they seemed no higher than
a man’s knee, and sitting under them was the cat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the companion I seek,” said fox-face. “By
magic she is bound and by magic only can she be loosed,
and I promise you that if you will but loose her I shall be
seen no more in your land.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fair enough,” said Nasca. “But I must be assured of
a return to my own place, for it is far from home on these
hills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is well enough,” answered fox-face. “Have you
not your flying mat? Though to be sure, as soon as you
take your foot from it it will vanish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nasca thought for a little while, and the more he thought
the more it seemed to him to be a good thing and not an
evil to loose the cat, so he asked the stranger to show him
the bond that held her. At that fox-face pointed, and there
almost at his feet Nasca beheld a slender thread, like a hair,
that ran this way and that as far as the eye could see. So
with a blow of the magic ax he cut the thread, and there
was a noise like thunder and the thread ends slid away like
swift snakes. Nor did the stranger play Nasca false, for
in a flash he found himself back again at the foot of the
tree where the magic ax had hung, and so swiftly had the
journey been made that a man who had stooped to fill his
calabash at a pool when Nasca left, was even then straightening
himself to go away, his calabash being filled. As
for the fox-faced stranger, no one ever saw him again, for
the cat being awakened, her dream had ended. And at
the moment when the thread was cut, the man who had
been bound in air came back again, his enchantment finished,
and the things that had died about him, because of
invisible forces, sprang to life again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what of the cat? For Nasca little thought that he
had loosed a fearful thing on the world, a frightful form
of giant mould of a size bigger than a bull. Nor did he
know until one evening, as he sat by the fire, it being chill
in that high place at times, he turned his head as the robe
that hung at the door bulged into the house. He looked to
see his grandmother, but instead a great cat filled the doorway,
a cat with green eyes, each the size of an egg. Indeed
so great was the cat that it had to crouch low to enter. And
when within, the room was filled with it, a sight that made
the heart of Nasca stand still. A gloomy terror it was, and
most fiendish was the look that it gave the lad. But Nasca,
though terror-stricken, yet showed no sign of fear. Instead,
he made room for the cat by the fire as though he saw cats
like that every day. So the cat sat by the fire and close to
Nasca, sometimes looking at the blaze without winking,
sometimes turning its great head to look for long and long
at the boy. Once Nasca stood up, saying that he would go
outside and bring in more wood for the fire, privately thinking
to get out of the place in safety, but the great paw of the
cat shot out with claws that looked like reaping hooks,
whereupon Nasca sat down again saying that, after all, the
fire would live awhile. But he thought and thought and
the cat looked and looked, and the place was as still and
quiet as a midnight pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Nasca found heart to say something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you want to stay here and rest,” he said to the cat, “I
shall go away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must not go away,” said the cat in a soft voice,
stretching out one of her paws with the cruel claws showing
a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that a long time passed and the fire flamed only a
little, and the shadow of the cat was big and black on the
wall, and Nasca thought and thought and the cat looked
and looked. Then the firelight danced and the big black
shadow seemed to leap and then grow small, and the cat’s
eyes were full of a cold fire as they rested on Nasca.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly Nasca broke into a laugh, though, to be
sure, the laugh did not come from his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you laugh?” said the cat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you are so big and I am so little, but for all that
I can run ten times faster than you,” answered Nasca, and
his words sounded bold enough. He added: “All living
creatures would agree in that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is nonsense,” said the cat, her jealousy at once
aroused. “I am the fastest creature on earth. I can leap
over mountains and I take rivers at a step.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does not matter what you can do,” said Nasca, growing
bolder every second. “Let me tell you this: While a man
stooped to fill his calabash, I went from this place to a far
mountain, cut the thread that bound you, and returned before
the man with the calabash had straightened himself,
and if you do not believe it, I will bring the man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nasca said all this with some idea of getting an excuse
to go from there, but the words struck deep and the cat
wondered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you loose me?” asked the cat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I wanted to run a race with you,” answered
Nasca.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we run a race it must be for a wager,” said the cat.
“If you lose I make a meal of you. Is it agreed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fairly spoken,” said Nasca, “though to be sure if you
lose I make no meal of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us run to-morrow then,” said Nasca. “And I shall
sleep well under the tree and be fresh in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so,” said the cat. “If we run, we run at midnight
and under the cold white moon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So be it,” answered Nasca. “Where shall we run?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Across the mountains and back again, seven times,” said
the cat, choosing the highlands, because she knew that she
could leap over hills and cañons, while Nasca would have
to climb up and down, and choosing night because she could
see better in the dark than Nasca. For the cat was very
wise. But Nasca on his part thought of little more than
getting away from the cat for a while. So he told the cat
that he would bring a basket of fish for her supper, which
he did, and while the cat ate he went outside and sought his
grandmother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wise old woman laughed when she heard the story.
“To a cat her cattishness,” she said, “but to a woman her wit.
All falls out well enough. Haste, run and bring me the
magic ax.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But no,” said Nasca. “To use that would but make two
terrible cats, and one is more than enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heed me, Nasca, and bring the ax,” she repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that the boy ran swiftly and brought the ax.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now stand, Nasca, and fear not,” said the old woman,
and lifted the ax. So the lad stood, closing his eyes when
he saw her raise the ax to strike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then with a swift blow she brought the weapon down on
Nasca’s head, cutting him in two, and in a moment there
stood before her two Nascas, each as like the other as one
blade of grass is like another. Surely and well had the ax
done its work. One Nasca was as shapely as the other, one
as fair-skinned as the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said the old woman, “happy was I with one
Nasca, so doubly happy shall I be with two. So stay you
here, Nasca the first, and Nasca the second must come with
me. Oh, a merry world and a glad will it be now, since
joy and gladness are doubled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that she remembered that she had told neither lad
anything, in her delight, so she turned again to the first
Nasca.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait here for the great cat,” she said. “Go with her
to the great cañon where the race must start, and when the
cat makes to leap across, which she will do, do you climb
down a little way, then hide yourself until the cat returns.
Doubtless we shall be able to manage matters at the other
end. But see to it that you chide the cat for her slowness
when she returns after the first run, and we shall see what
we shall see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having said that, the old woman set off with Nasca the
second, walking bravely over the ridges and hills that rose
one behind the other like the waves of the sea. And when
they had come to a far place where the mountain dropped
down like a great stone wall to a fearful depth, they sat
them down to wait, Nasca the second being in plain sight,
the old woman hiding behind a rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as soon as the moon rose the great cat walked to
where Nasca the first stood, her eyes glaring terribly and
her hair all a-bristle. So horrible a sight was she that for
a moment Nasca went deadly pale, but he spoke boldly
enough, nevertheless, for the brave one is not he that does
not fear, but rather he that fears and yet does the thing that
he has set out to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing,” said Nasca to the cat. “Is it right that you
should leap over the cañon, going from one side to the other
like a bird, while I must climb down and then up again?
Let us make things fairer in the race, and do you climb
down and up the other side with me.” But all this he said
in a kind of spirit of mischief, knowing full well that the cat
would give him no chance at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! What is to do now?” said the cat with a hiss and
a sneer. “Does your heart fail you already? Are you
terror-tormented at the start? A fine racer, you, indeed!
No, no, my fine lad. We race for a supper and you must
supply the meal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To that Nasca answered nothing, so there was a little
silence, broken only by the hooting of the owl who was, indeed,
trying to tell the cat the truth of matters. But the
cat was too full of her own notions and had no ear for
others. She lay crouched on the ground, ready to make a
spring, and Nasca wondered whether her jump would be
at him or across the cañon. Suddenly, in a voice like
thunder, the cat called: “START!” and at the word, leaped
across the valley and was off and away, without as much as
giving a glance at the lad. But he made a great deal of
fuss on his part, climbing down the face of the cañon wall.
The cat, on landing on the other side, looked back, then gave
a cry of triumph, seeing the poor start that Nasca had
made. “Come on! Come on!” she called. “The run will
sharpen my appetite,” and even as she said that, she was a
distance off, then bounding away up hill and down hill, over
the ridges, over the rocks, over the streams, taking a hundred
yards at a bound. So in a very short space of time she
came to the place where Nasca the second stood, and was
mightily astonished to see her opponent, as she thought,
there before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too easy, señora cat, too easy,” said Nasca the second,
speaking as the grandmother bade him. “I thought cats
were swifter. Doubtless you play, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing that speech the cat was full of anger and in a
voice that shook the mountains, she roared: “BACK!
BACK AGAIN! I’ll show you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Off ran Nasca the second then, but the cat passed him like
lightning, her very whiskers streaming behind, and as soon
as she was over the first hill the lad went back to the place
where his grandmother was. Señora cat knew nothing of
that, though, and went bounding as before, tearing up hill
and down hill, over the ridges, over the rocks, over the
streams, taking two hundred yards at a leap, and at last
came to the place of beginning, to behold Nasca, who stood
smiling and wiping his brow lightly, as if he had been
running.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much better, señora cat,” he said. “You almost caught
me that time. A little faster and you would have won. But
still I have more speed in me to let loose. Come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner were the words out of his mouth than he
started off, making as though to climb down the cañon
wall, and the cat gave a screech that shook the very skies and
made the pale moon quiver. So fast she went that the very
trees and bushes that she passed were scorched, and as for
the rocks over which she flew, they were melted by the heat
of the air. Every leap that she took was four hundred
yards. Up hill and down hill she went, over the ridges,
over the rocks, over the streams, and so at last she came once
more to where the second Nasca stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good run that, señora cat,” he said. “I think that we
shall finish the race soon and in a way that I may live and
be happy, though for me you must go supperless. Certainly
I must try, for to lose will profit me nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the cat was at her wits’ end, supposing that Nasca
ran faster than she. She opened her mouth to shriek, but
fast upon her came a great feebleness, and she faltered and
reeled and then fell down in a faint, seeing nothing at all.
No time then did the second Nasca and the old woman lose.
Putting themselves to the task, they rolled the cat to the
edge of the great rock wall that ran down straight. Then
after a pause to gain breath they gave another push, and
the body of the giant cat fell over the edge and was broken
to pieces on the sharp rocks below. So that was the end
of the cat and the end of her dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two Nascas and the old woman went to their own
place and told the people all that had happened, so there
was great rejoicing, and laughter and song and weaving of
garlands, and everybody was happy. And ever since there
has been kindness and good fellowship in that land. And
for those who would see signs of the tale there stand the three
great rocks on the highlands, each so heavy that two hundred
men could not lift them, and wise men wonder much what
manner of men put them there. But only those who are
not wise and learned know the truth of the matter, as you
may test for yourself by asking any very wise men who come
to visit you.</p>
